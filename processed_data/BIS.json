[{"Title":"Greenhouse gas emissions and bank lending","Link":"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/work1078.htm","Date":"2023-03-03T13:00:00Z","Abstract":"This paper investigates the effect of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of firms on bank loans using bank\u2013firm matched data of Japanese listed firms from 2006 to 2018. Previous findings suggest that climate risks priced in corporate bonds or syndicated loans are statistically significant but economically minor. This paper investigates bank lending behavior in terms of the loan amount, which we consider to have a more direct effect on firm investment decisions.","Author":" Koji Takahashi and Junnosuke Shino","Number":"1078"},{"Title":"Understanding post-Covid inflation dynamics","Link":"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/work1077.htm","Date":"2023-02-28T13:00:00Z","Abstract":"We propose a macroeconomic model with a nonlinear Phillips curve that has a flat slope when inflationary pressures are subdued and steepens when inflationary pressures are elevated. The nonlinear Phillips curve in our model arises due to a quasi-kinked demand schedule for goods produced by firms.","Author":" Mart\u00edn Harding, Jesper Lind\u00e9 and Mathias Trabandt","Number":"1077"},{"Title":"The shape of business cycles: a cross-country analysis of Friedman's plucking theory","Link":"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/work1076.htm","Date":"2023-02-23T09:20:00Z","Abstract":"Our paper presents new evidence on the shape of business cycles in advanced economies.

Our dataset is on long-term government bonds and provides a more complete coverage of bonds issued in domestic markets. We document several salient trends. While a preponderance of foreign currency bonds is associated with greater holdings by foreign investors, the correlation is weak at best.","Author":" Mert Onen, Hyun Song Shin and Goetz von Peter","Number":"1075"},{"Title":"Non-bank lending during crises","Link":"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/work1074.htm","Date":"2023-02-16T13:00:00Z","Abstract":"This paper shows that non-banks curtail their syndicated credit by significantly more than banks during crises, even after accounting for time-varying lender and borrower characteristics.","Author":" I\u00f1aki Aldasoro, Sebastian Doerr and Haonan Zhou","Number":"1074"},{"Title":"Constrained liquidity provision in currency markets","Link":"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/work1073.htm","Date":"2023-02-14T13:00:00Z","Abstract":"We find that both measures are economically significant.

We apply our theory to offshoring and trade, where firms strike a balance between the productivity gain due to offshoring against the greater financial cost due to longer supply chains. In equilibrium, the ratio of trade to GDP, inventories and productivity are procyclical and closely track financial conditions.","Author":" Se-Jik Kim and Hyun Song Shin","Number":"1070"},{"Title":"Global financial cycle and liquidity management","Link":"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/work1069.htm","Date":"2023-01-25T09:00:00Z","Abstract":"We use a tractable model to show that emerging markets can protect themselves from the global financial cycle by expanding (rather than restricting) capital flows.

Motivated by this fact, we develop an international corporate finance model in which firms facing adverse selection choose the foreign currency share of their debt.
