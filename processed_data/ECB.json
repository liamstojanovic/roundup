This paper analyzes the implications of the change from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 in the context of bank resilience. We shed light on two effects. First, the \u201ccliff-effect\u201d, which refers to sudden increases in impairments. It occurred under IAS 39, as credit losses were only recognized with hindsight, and thus late and abruptly. IFRS 9 was designed to mitigate this issue through a staging approach, which gradually recognizes expected credit losses (ECL). These anticipated impairments, however, constitute a significant \u201cfront-loading\u201d, which is the second effect we investigate. The earlier recognition of losses may adversely impact bank resilience through lower capital levels. In the absence of archival data of IFRS 9 and their potential biases due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we use the European bank stress test results as a natural experiment, in which all banks are subject to the same regulations and exogenous shocks. This characteristic allows us to isolate otherwise immeasurable effects and empirically investigate, whether the conjunction of both effects constitutes a net benefit to banks\u2019 resilience. Furthermore, the vigorousness of procyclicality under IFRS 9 can be compared to IAS 39 by contrasting a hypothetical baseline and an adverse scenario.","Author":"Arndt -Gerrit Kund , Daniel Rugilo","Number":"2792"},{"Title":"Testing for differences in survey-based density expectations: a compositional data approach","Link":"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/\/pub\/pdf\/scpwps\/ecb.wp2791~63b402562b.en.pdf","Date":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100","Abstract":"We propose to treat survey-based density expectations as compositional data when testing either for heterogeneity in density forecasts across different groups of agents or for changes over time. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed test has more power relative to both a bootstrap approach based on the KLIC and an approach which involves multiple testing for differences of individual parts of the density. In addition, the test is computaionally much faster than the KLIC-based one, which relies on simulations, and allows for comparisons across multiple groups. Using density expectations from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters and the U.S. Survey of Consumer Expectations, we show the usefulness of the test in detecting possible changes in density expectations over time and across different types of forecasters.","Author":"Testing for differences in survey - based density expectations: a compositional data approach Jonas Dovern , Alexander Glas , Geoff Kenny","Number":"2791"},{"Title":"Euro area banks\u2019 market power, lending channel and stability: the effects of negative policy rates","Link":"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/\/pub\/pdf\/scpwps\/ecb.wp2790~9e2844fdb8.en.pdf","Date":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100","Abstract":"This paper investigates to what extent the introduction of negative monetary policy rates altered competitive behaviour in the euro area banking sector.

Asset-pricing theory suggests that real house prices respond to changes in real interest rates in a non-linear fashion. This non-linearity should be especially pronounced at very low real interest rates. Most existing empirical studies estimate models with a con-stant semi-elasticity, thereby ruling out by design the potential non-linearities between house prices and interest rates. To address this issue, we estimate a panel model for the euro area countries with a constant interest rate elasticity (as opposed to a constant semi-elasticity), which is consistent with asset pricing theory. Our empirical results suggest that, in a low interest rate environment such as the period between 2015 and 2021, non-linearities in the house price response to interest rate changes are important: an increase of real interest rates from ultra-low levels could lead to downward pressure on real house prices three to eight times higher than the literature suggests.","Author":"Daniel Dieckelmann , Hannah S.

This paper studies the optimal response to stochastic changes of the long-run natural rate in a suitably modified version of the new Keynesian model. We show that, because of the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, movements towards zero of the long-run natural rate cause an increasingly large downward bias in expectations. To offset this bias, the central bank should aim to keep the real interest rate systematically below the long-run natural rate, as long as policy is not constrained by the ZLB. The neutral rate \u2013 the level of the policy rate consistent with stable inflation and the natural rate at its long-run level \u2013 will be lower than the long-run natural rate. This is the case both under optimal policy, and under a price level targeting rule. In the latter case, the neutral rate is equal to zero as soon as the long-run natural rate falls below 1%.","Author":"Sandra Daudignon , Oreste Tristani","Number":"2788"},{"Title":"Evaluating the impact of dividend restrictions on euro area bank market values","Link":"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/\/pub\/pdf\/scpwps\/ecb.wp2787~04133e65f9.en.pdf","Date":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100","Abstract":"This paper evaluates the impact of the March 2020 European Central Bank recommenda-tion that banks do not pay dividends or buy back shares on their market values.

Decisions with judgment test whether a judgmental decision is optimal and, in case of rejection, move to the closest boundary of the confidence interval, for a given confidence level. The resulting decisions condition on sample realizations, which are used to construct the confidence interval itself. Bayesian decisions condition on sample realizations twice, with the tested hypothesis and with the choice of the confidence level. The second conditioning reveals that Bayesian decision makers have an ex ante confidence level equal to one, which is equivalent to assuming an uncertainty neutral behavior. Robust Bayesian decisions are characterized by an ex ante confidence level strictly lower than one and are therefore uncertainty averse.","Author":"Simone Manganelli","Number":"2786"},{"Title":"Credibility gains from communicating with the public: evidence from the ECB\u2019s new monetary policy strategy","Link":"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/\/pub\/pdf\/scpwps\/ecb.wp2785~0243b480bf.en.pdf","Date":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100","Abstract":"We show that the announcement of the ECB\u2019s Strategy Review and the revision of its inflation target in summer 2021 went largely unnoticed by the wider public.

First, using cross-country bank-level data we find that after a tightening of household-specific macroprudential policy during a credit expansion, banks with larger portfolios of residential mortgages increase their corporate lending by more than banks with smaller mortgage portfolios. Second, we compute three country-level measures of the riskiness of corporate credit allocation based on firm-level data. Consistently across the measures, an unexpected tightening of household-specific macroprudential tools during a credit expansion is followed by an increase in riskiness of corporate credit. These effects are quantitatively meaningful: the riskiness of corporate credit increases by around 10 percent of the historical standard deviation following an unexpected policy tightening. Further evidence from bank lending standards surveys suggests that the leakage effects are stronger for larger firms com-pared to SMEs, consistent with recent evidence on the use of personal real estate as loan collateral by small firms.","Author":"Leakages from macroprudential regulations: the case of household - specific tools and corporate credit Apoorv Bhargava , Lucyna G\u00f3rnicka , Peichu Xie","Number":"2784"},{"Title":"CBDC and financial stability","Link":"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/\/pub\/pdf\/scpwps\/ecb.wp2783~0af3ad7576.en.pdf","Date":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100","Abstract":"What is the effect of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability? We answer this question by studying a model of financial intermediation with an endogenously determined probability of a bank run, using global games. As an alternative to bank deposits, consumers can also store their wealth in remunerated CBDC issued by the central bank. Consistent with widespread concerns among policymakers, higher CBDC remuneration increases the withdrawal incentives of consumers, and thus bank fragility. However, the bank optimally responds to the additional competition by offering better deposit rates to retain funding, which reduces fragility. Thus, the overall relationship between CBDC remuneration and bank fragility is U-shaped.","Author":"Toni Ahnert , Peter Ho ffmann , Agnese Leonello , Davide Porcellacchia","Number":"2783"},{"Title":"Loan guarantees, bank underwriting policies and financial fragility","Link":"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/\/pub\/pdf\/scpwps\/ecb.wp2782~4f5e7a6fa8.en.pdf","Date":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 11:00:00 +0100","Abstract":"Loan guarantees represent a form of government intervention to support bank lending.

This links consecutive cross-sections in the panel together, substantially reduces flickering, and enhances the economic interpretability of the outcome.
