Exploiting regional and firm-level variation in three pandemic policies in the UK, we find that financially healthy firms increased vacancies more in response to positive shocks. Less-leveraged firms and firms with higher credit scores increased postings more in response to the Eat Out to Help Out\u2019s local demand subsidies and after receiving a Bounce Back Loan Scheme loan, respectively. These findings complement the link between leverage and employment losses in response to negative shocks."],"Author":"David Van Dijcke, Marcus Buckmann, Arthur Turrell and Tomas Key","Number":"1033"},{"Title":"Hedging, market concentration and monetary policy: a joint analysis of gilt and derivatives exposures","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/hedging-market-concentration-and-monetary-policy-a-joint-analysis-of-gilt-and-derivatives-exposures","Date":"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 14:01:00 +0100","Abstract":["By Gabor Pinter and Danny Walker\u00a0\n\nWe use granular data sets \u2013 merged across the UK government bond, interest rate swap, options and futures markets \u2013 to estimate exposures to interest rate risk at the sector level and for individual funds within the same sector. We focus on non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) such as insurance companies, pension funds, asset managers and hedge funds. We find that NBFIs tend to use derivatives to amplify bond market exposures to interest rate risk, rather than to hedge them. Moreover, interest rate derivatives usage is highly concentrated among a few investors, which could increase the aggregate consequences of idiosyncratic shocks to these investors. We show that this market concentration impedes the monetary policy transmission to asset prices. We also find that monetary policy loosening (tightening) causes NBFIs to take on more (less) interest rate risk via derivatives, consistent with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy."],"Author":"Gabor Pinter and Danny Walker","Number":"1032"},{"Title":"The market for sharing interest rate risk: quantities behind prices","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/the-market-for-sharing-interest-rate-risk-quantities-behind-prices","Date":"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["By Umang Khetan, Ioana Neam\u021bu and Ishita Sen\n\nWe study the extent of interest rate risk sharing across the financial system. We use granular positions and transactions data in interest rate swaps, covering over 60% of overall swap activity in the world. We show that pension and insurance (PF&I) sector emerges as a natural counterparty to banks and corporations: overall, and in response to decline in rates, PF&I buy duration, whereas banks and corporations sell duration. This cross-sector netting reduces the aggregate net demand that is supplied by dealers. However, two factors impede cross-sector netting and add to dealer imbalances across maturities. (i) PF&I, bank and corporate demand is segmented across maturities. (ii) Large volumes are traded by hedge funds, who behave like banks in the short-end and like PF&I in the long-end. This worsens segmentation, exposing dealers to a steepening or flattening of the yield curve in addition to residual duration risk. Consistent with this, we find that demand pressure, in particular hedge funds\u2019 trades, impact swap spreads across maturities. We also document that long-tenor pension fund trades are less likely to be centrally cleared, adding counterparty credit risk to demand imbalances."],"Author":"Umang Khetan, Ioana Neam\u021bu and Ishita Sen","Number":"1031"},{"Title":"Unwinding quantitative easing: state dependency and household heterogeneity","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/unwinding-quantitative-easing-state-dependency-and-household-heterogeneity","Date":"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["This paper studies the macroeconomic effect of the state dependency of central bank asset market operations and their interactions with household heterogeneity. We build a New Keynesian model with borrowers and savers in which quantitative easing and tightening operate through portfolio rebalancing between short-term and long-term government bonds. We quantify the aggregate impact of an occasionally binding zero lower bound in determining an asymmetry between the effects of asset purchases and sales. When close to the lower bound, raising the nominal interest rate prior to unwinding quantitative easing minimises the economic costs of monetary policy normalisation. Furthermore, our results imply that household heterogeneity in combination with state dependency amplifies the revealed asymmetry, while household heterogeneity alone does not amplify the aggregate effects of asset market operations."],"Author":"Cristiano Cantore and Pascal Meichtry","Number":"1030"},{"Title":"Yield curve sensitivity to investor positioning around economic shocks","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/yield-curve-sensitivity-to-investor-positioning-around-economic-shocks","Date":"Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["Speculative trading activity may either support efficient market functioning or introduce price distortions.

This provides measures of expected inflation cleaned from liquidity frictions. We first show that this market is segmented: pension funds trade at long horizons while hedge funds trade at short horizons, with dealer banks as their counterparties in both markets. This segmentation suggests three identification strategies \u2013 sign restrictions, granular instrumental variables, and heteroskedasticity \u2013 for the demand and supply functions of each investor type. Across the three strategies, we find that (i) prices absorb new information within three days; (ii) the supply of long-horizon inflation protection is very elastic; and (iii) short-horizon price movements are unreliable measures of expected inflation as they primarily reflect liquidity shocks. Our counterfactual measure of long-horizon expected inflation in the absence of these shocks suggests that the risk of a deflation trap during the pandemic and of a persistent rise in inflation following the energy shocks were overstated, while since Autumn of 2022, expected inflation has been lower and falling more rapidly than conventional measures."],"Author":"Saleem Bahaj, Robert Czech, Sitong Ding and Ricardo Reis","Number":"1028"},{"Title":"The transmission of macroprudential policy in the tails: evidence from a narrative approach","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/the-transmission-of-macroprudential-policy-in-the-tails-evidence-from-a-narrative-approach","Date":"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["We estimate the causal effects of macroprudential policies on the entire distribution of\u00a0GDP growth by incorporating a narrative-identification strategy within a quantile-regression\u00a0framework.

Drawing on trade\u2011level regulatory data, we study the netting benefits for UK dealers if comprehensive central clearing had been introduced to the cash gilt and gilt repo markets ahead of the March 2020 dash for cash (DFC) crisis. For the gilt repo market, we estimate that the policy would have reduced the gilt repo exposures on UK dealers\u2019 balance sheets by 40% and, hence, boosted their aggregate leverage ratio by 3 basis points. If that policy had been accompanied by standardisation of repo maturity dates, such that they fell on the same day of the week (apart from for overnight repo), the reduction in exposures would have risen to 60% and the increase in the aggregate leverage ratio to 5 basis points. Such improvements in netting rates would in principle have allowed the dealers\u2019 repo desks to expand their trading during the DFC by 2.5 times more than under prevailing clearing rates for each incremental unit of capital available to them. For cash gilt trades, central clearing would only have reduced unsettled trade exposures for dealers using a particular accounting treatment, but would have done so by up to 80% for that group, boosting its aggregate leverage ratio by 0.4 basis points. However, changes to the computation of the Basel III leverage ratio implemented in January 2023 would also have had these effects on cash trades."],"Author":"Yuliya Baranova, Eleanor Holbrook, David MacDonald, William Rawstorne, Nicholas Vause and Georgia Waddington","Number":"1026"},{"Title":"Flexible Bayesian MIDAS: time\u2011variation, group\u2011shrinkage and\u00a0sparsity","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/flexible-bayesian-midas-time-variation-group-shrinkage-and-sparsity","Date":"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["We propose a mixed\u2011frequency regression prediction approach that models a time\u2011varying trend, stochastic volatility and fat tails in the variable of interest.

A new sparsification algorithm on the posterior motivated by Bayesian decision theory derives inclusion probabilities over lag groups, thus making the results easy to communicate without imposing sparsity a priori. An empirical application on nowcasting UK GDP growth suggests that group\u2011shrinkage in combination with the time\u2011varying components substantially increases nowcasting performance by reading signals from an economically meaningful subset of indicators, whereas the time\u2011varying components help by allowing the model to switch between indicators.

Results suggest that monetary policy has greater output effects in industries featuring assets that are more difficult to collateralise, consistent with the credit channel, followed by industries producing durables, as predicted by the interest rate channel. The credit channel is stronger during bad times as well as in countries with lower levels of financial development, in line with financial accelerator logic.
