In this paper, I formalise and strengthen this common knowledge by showing that neither the production function nor Hicks\u2011neutral productivity can be identified when revenue is used as a proxy for physical output. This result holds under the standard assumptions used in the literature for a large class of production functions, including all commonly used parametric forms. Among the prevalent approaches to address this issue, I show that only those which impose assumptions on the underlying demand system can possibly identify the production function."],"Author":["By\u00a0David Van Dijcke"],"Number":"1015"},{"Title":"Do firm expectations respond to monetary policy announcements?","Link":"http:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/do-firm-expectations-respond-to-monetary-policy-announcements","Date":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 14:00:00 Z","Abstract":["We study whether firms\u2019 expectations react to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy announcements by comparing the responses to the Decision Maker Panel survey filed immediately before and after a Monetary Policy Committee meeting. On the one hand, we find that firms\u2019 expectations and uncertainty about their own business for the most part do not respond to high-frequency monetary policy surprises. On the other hand, announced changes in the monetary policy rate induce firms to revise their price expectations, with rate hikes inducing a reduction in price expectations and uncertainty surrounding them."],"Author":["By Federico Di Pace, Giacomo Mangiante and Riccardo Masolo"],"Number":"1014"},{"Title":"The cyclicality of bank credit losses and capital ratios under expected loss model","Link":"http:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/the-cyclicality-of-bank-credit-losses-and-capital-ratios-under-expected-loss-model","Date":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 14:00:00 Z","Abstract":["We model the evolution of stylised bank loan portfolios to assess the impact of IFRS 9 and US GAAP expected loss model (ECL) on the cyclicality of loan write-off losses, loan loss provisions (LLPs) and capital ratios of banks, relative to the incurred loss model of IAS 39. We focus on the interaction between the changes in LLPs' charges (the flow channel) and stocks (the stock channel) under ECL. Our results show that, when GDP growth does not demonstrate high volatility, ECL model smooths the impact of credit losses on profits and capital resources, reducing the procyclicality of capital and leverage ratios, especially under US GAAP. However, when GDP growth is highly volatile, the large differences in lifetime probabilities of defaults (PDs) between booms and busts cause sharp increases in LLPs in deep downturns, as seen for US banks during the Covid-19 crisis. Volatile GDP growth makes capital and leverage ratios more procyclical, with sharper falls in both ratios in deep downturns under US GAAP, compared to IAS 39. IFRS 9 ECL demonstrates less sensitivity to lifetime PDs fluctuations due to the existence of loan stages, and hence can reduce the procyclicality of capital and leverage ratios, even when GDP is highly volatile."],"Author":["By Mahmoud Fatouh and Simone Giansante"],"Number":"1013"},{"Title":"Useful, usable, and used?

Using a difference\u2011in\u2011differences empirical strategy we test whether regulatory capital buffers, a key component of the Basel III reforms, helped to support lending provision by UK banks through Covid\u201119. To identify credit supply effects, we exploit data on the universe of UK mortgages, which were outside the scope of government guaranteed lending schemes. We find that more constrained banks defended their capital surpluses to a greater extent during the pandemic, and did so by maintaining higher loan rates, lower loan values, and tighter terms on riskier lending. In contrast, banks receiving greater capital relief from the cut to the UK countercyclical capital buffer during the pandemic maintained more stable capital ratios, lending provision and risk\u2011taking capacity. Our results suggest regulatory buffers may be less usable than intended, but buffer releases can dampen these unintended consequences."],"Author":["By Aakriti Mathur, Matthew Naylor and Aniruddha Rajan\u00a0"],"Number":"1011"},{"Title":"Nonbank lenders as global shock absorbers: evidence from US\u00a0monetary policy spillovers","Link":"http:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/nonbank-lenders-as-global-shock-absorbers-evidence-from-us-monetary-policy-spillovers","Date":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 14:00:00 Z","Abstract":[""],"Author":["By David Elliott, Ralf R Meisenzahl and Jos\u00e9-Luis Peydr\u00f3"],"Number":"1012"},{"Title":"Negative rates, monetary policy transmission and cross-border lending via international financial centres","Link":"http:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/negative-rates-monetary-policy-transmission-and-cross-border-lending","Date":"Fri, 06 Jan 2023 14:00:00 Z","Abstract":["We study the effects of negative interest rate policies (NIRP) on the transmission of monetary policy through cross-border lending.

We find that NIRP impairs the bank-lending channel for cross\u2011border lending to non-bank sectors, especially for those banks that have only a weak deposit base in IFCs \u2013 and are thus relatively more exposed to NIRP in their headquarters. Using euro-area data, including bank-level data from France, we find that NIRP does not influence overall cross-border lending from banks\u2019 headquarters\u2019 economies, but NIRP does impair lending to financial sectors based in IFCs.

Using administrative data from the UK, the paper finds that the choice of fixation length tracks the life-cycle decline of credit risk in the mortgage market: the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio decreases and collateral coverage improves over the life of the loan due to principal repayment and house price appreciation. High-LTV borrowers, who pay large initial credit spreads, trade off their insurance motive against reducing credit spreads over time using shorter-term contracts. To quantify demand for long-term contracts, I develop a life-cycle model of optimal mortgage fixation choice. With baseline house price growth and interest rate risk, households prefer shorter-term contracts at high LTV levels, and longer-term contracts once LTV is sufficiently low, in line with the data. The mechanism helps explain reduced and heterogeneous demand for long-term mortgage contracts."],"Author":["By Lu Liu"],"Number":"1009"},{"Title":"Measuring the effects of bank remuneration rules: evidence from the UK","Link":"http:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2022\/measuring-the-effects-of-bank-remuneration-rules-evidence-from-the-uk","Date":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 10:00:00 Z","Abstract":["In this paper, we study whether and how some of the remuneration rules introduced after the\u00a0Global Financial Crisis affected bankers\u2019 compensation using a unique regulatory dataset on\u00a0remuneration in six major UK banks during 2014\u201319.

Using non\u2011linear methods, I empirically find that during heightened disagreement, monetary policy has a smaller effect on inflation, yet more influence over output. As a proxy for information frictions, I use real GDP nowcast disagreement across professional forecasters. Significant nowcast disagreement indicates when it is difficult to observe the current economic state, or a period of high information rigidities.
