93,Micro- and Macroeconomic Impacts of a Place-Based Industrial Policy,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31293,2023-06-01,"We investigate the impact of a set of place-based subsidies introduced in Turkey in 2012. Using firm-level balance-sheet data along with data on the domestic production network, we first assess the policy’s direct and indirect impacts. We find an increase in economic activity in industry-province pairs that were the focus of the subsidy program, and positive spillovers to the suppliers and customers of subsidized firms. With the aid of a dynamic multi-region, multi-industry general equilibrium model, we then assess the program’s impacts. Based on the calibrated model we find that, in the long run, the subsidy program is modestly successful in reducing inequality between the relatively under-developed and more prosperous portions of the country. These modest longer-term effects are due to the ability of households to migrate in response to the subsidy program and to input-output linkages that traverse subsidy regions within Turkey.","['Enghin Atalay', 'Ali Hortaçsu', 'Mustafa Runyun', 'Chad Syverson', 'Mehmet Fatih Ulu']",31293
95,Exchange Controls As A Fiscal Instrument,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31294,2023-06-01,"About 20 percent of countries have in place dual, multiple, or parallel exchange rates. Exchange controls represent a form of distortionary commercial policy. We show that they can also deflate the real value of external public debt. We study an optimal taxation problem of a government with chronic fiscal deficits and two distortionary instruments, money creation and exchange controls. We calibrate the model to Argentina, which over the past decade has experienced significant exchange controls and persistent fiscal deficits. We show that exchange controls can generate sizable fiscal revenue. However, the optimal level of exchange controls is virtually zero. Financing the fiscal deficit with exchange controls is possible but entails large welfare losses.","['Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé', 'Martín Uribe']",31294
96,Unveiling Specialization Trends in Economics Research: A Large-Scale Study Using Natural Language Processing and Citation Analysis,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31295,2023-06-01,"This article presents a comprehensive analysis of trends in the publication and citation of economics scholarly research, with a focus on specialization within fields of economics research (i.e., applied, applied theory, econometrics methods, and theory). We collected detailed data on 24,273 articles published from 1970 to 2016 in highly regarded general research economics journals. We then used state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to further enrich the collected data. Our findings reveal significant disparities in article content and citations across fields of economics research. The analysis indicates growing specialization trends in theory and econometric methods. In contrast, applied papers are covering a wider range of topics and receiving an increasing proportion of extramural citations over time. By 2016, applied ranked among the most or second most cited field by any other field of economics research. These patterns are consistent with applied papers becoming more multidisciplinary. Applied theory articles have also demonstrated a growing breadth of topics covered (similar to applied articles); however, this has not been accompanied by an increase in extramural citations or in the share of citations received from other fields of economics research (as observed with theory articles). This makes it challenging to determine their specialization status.","['Sebastian Galiani', 'Ramiro H. Gálvez', 'Ian Nachman']",31295
88,Dollarization Dynamics,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31296,2023-06-01,"This study explores the consequences of dollarizing an economy with an initial dollar shortage. We show that the resulting transitional dynamics are tantamount to that of a “sudden stop”: consumption of tradable goods fall, the real exchange rate depreciates abruptly by a discrete drop in domestic prices and wages followed by a gradual appreciation from positive inflation. With nominal rigidities the economy first falls into a recession. This is true even if all prices and wages are allowed to adjust flexibly on impact. The subsequent recovery in activity always “overshoots” the steady state: the non-tradable sector transitions from the initial recession to a boom, then asymptotes to its steady state.","['Tomás E.

90,Pareto Improving Fiscal and Monetary Policies: Samuelson in the New Keynesian Model,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31297,2023-06-01,"This paper explores the positive and normative consequences of government bond issuances in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, focusing on how the stock of government bonds affects the cross-sectional allocation of resources in the spirit of Samuelson (1958). We characterize the Pareto optimal levels of government bonds and the associated monetary policy adjustments that should accompany Pareto-improving bond issuances. The paper introduces a simple phase diagram to analyze the global equilibrium dynamics of inflation, interest rates, and labor earnings in response to changes in the stock of government debt. The framework also provides a tractable tool to explore the use of fiscal policy to escape the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates and the resolution of the “forward guidance puzzle.” A common theme throughout is that following the monetary policy guidance from the standard Ricardian framework leads to excess fluctuations in income and inflation.","['Mark A.

85,The Debt-Inflation Channel of the German Hyperinflation,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31298,2023-06-01,"This paper studies how a large increase in the price level is transmitted to the real economy through firm balance sheets. Using newly digitized macro- and micro-level data from the German inflation of 1919-1923, we show that inflation led to a large reduction in real debt burdens and bankruptcies. Firms with higher nominal liabilities at the onset of inflation experienced a larger decline in interest expenses, a relative increase in their equity values, and higher employment during the inflation. The results are consistent with real effects of a debt-inflation channel that operates even when prices and wages are flexible.","['Markus K. Brunnermeier', 'Sergio A.

84,Accounting for the Duality of the Italian Economy,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31299,2023-06-01,"After 162 years of political unification, Italy still displays large regional economic differences. In 2019, the per capita GDP of Lombardia was 39,700 euros, but Calabria's per capita GDP was only 17,300 euros. We build a two-region, two-sector model of the Italian economy to measure the wedges that could account for the differences in aggregate variables between the North and the South. We find that the largest driver of the regional disparity in per capita output is the difference in total factor productivity, followed by fiscal redistribution. These two factors, together, account for more than 70 percent of the output disparity between the North and the South.","['Jesús Fernández-Villaverde', 'Dario Laudati', 'Lee E.

94,Firm Inflation Uncertainty,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31300,2023-06-01,"We introduce a new measure of own-price inflation uncertainty using firm-level data from a large and representative survey of UK businesses. Inflation uncertainty increased significantly from the start of 2021 and reached a peak in the second half of 2022, even as a similar measure of sales uncertainty declined. We also find large cross-sectional differences in inflation uncertainty, with uncertainty particularly elevated for smaller firms and those in the goods sector. Finally, we show that firms which are more uncertain about their own price expectations experience higher forecast errors 12 months later. These findings suggest that studying inflation uncertainty at the firm level may be an important new dimension to understanding firm performance.","['Ivan Yotzov', 'Lena Anayi', 'Nicholas Bloom', 'Philip Bunn', 'Paul Mizen', 'Özgen Öztürk', 'Gregory Thwaites']",31300
87,Cryptic Regulation of Crypto-Tokens,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31301,2023-06-01,"This paper investigates the alignment of existing securities regulations with the emerging landscape of crypto-tokens and blockchain technology. By examining the features of these digital assets, including decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and programmability, we analyze how they interact with existing financial rules. We compare approaches to regulation across countries, considering potential impacts on innovation. Furthermore, we explore the issues that may arise with blockchain networks, such as payment efficiency and market safety. The study aims to contribute to discussions about balancing innovation within the blockchain sphere and ensuring investor protection and market security, underlining areas that may necessitate regulatory improvements.",['Joshua S.

86,"Trade Wars, Nominal Rigidities and Monetary Policy",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31302,2023-06-01,"This paper shows that the outcome of trade wars for tariffs and welfare will be affected by the monetary policy regime. The key message is that trade policy interacts with monetary policy in a way that magnifies the welfare costs of discretionary monetary policy in an international setting. If countries follow monetary policies of flexible inflation targeting, trade wars are relatively mild, with low equilibrium tariffs and small welfare costs. Discretionary monetary policies imply much higher tariffs, high inflation rates, and substantially larger welfare costs. We quantify the effects of a global trade war among major economies using estimates of trade elasticities, economic size, net foreign assets and trade openness. We find large welfare benefits of an inflation targeting monetary policy for all countries.","['Stéphane Auray', 'Michael B. Devereux', 'Aurélien Eyquem']",31302
89,Information Acquisition and Rating Agencies,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31303,2023-06-01,"For decades credit rating agencies were viewed as trusted arbiters of creditworthiness and their ratings as important tools for managing risk. The common narrative is that the value of ratings was compromised by the evolution of the industry to a form where issuers pay for ratings. In this paper we consider both an investor-pays and an issuer-pays set-ups and show that if the investor-pays version can overcome the free-rider problem it is efficient, and otherwise leads to under-provision of information; while if the issuer-pays can force disclosure, it is efficient, but otherwise it leads to less revealing information because of the systematic distortion in revealed information along with over-investment in information. We show that in both these arrangements credit ratings have value in equilibrium and how reputation insures that, in equilibrium, ratings will reflect sound assessments of credit worthiness. We argue that regulatory reliance on ratings and the increasing importance of risk-weighted capital in prudential regulation have more likely contributed to distorted ratings than the matter of who pays for them.","['Harold L.

22,Money Matters: Broad Divisia Money and the Recovery of Nominal GDP from the COVID-19 Recession,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31304,2023-06-01,The rise of inflation in 2021 and 2022 surprised many macroeconomists who ignored the earlier surge in money growth because past instability in the demand for simple-sum monetary aggregates had made these aggregates unreliable indicators. We find that the demand for more theoretically-based divisia aggregates can be modeled and that their growth rates provide useful information for future nominal GDP growth.,"['Michael D.

91,Using Limited Trial Evidence to Credibly Choose Treatment Dosage when Efficacy and Adverse Effects Weakly Increase with Dose,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31305,2023-06-01,"In medical treatment and elsewhere, it has become standard to base treatment intensity (dosage) on evidence in randomized trials. Yet it has been rare to study how outcomes vary with dosage. In trials to obtain drug approval, the norm has been to specify some dose of a new drug and compare it with an established therapy or placebo. Design-based trial analysis views each trial arm as qualitatively different, but it may be highly credible to assume that efficacy and adverse effects (AEs) weakly increase with dosage. Optimization of patient care requires joint attention to both, as well as to treatment cost. This paper develops methodology to credibly use limited trial evidence to choose dosage when efficacy and AEs weakly increase with dose. I suppose that dosage is an integer choice t ∊ (0, 1, . . . , T), T being a specified maximum dose. I study dosage choice when trial evidence on outcomes is available for only K dose levels, where K < T + 1. Then the population distribution of dose response is partially rather than point identified. The identification region is a convex polygon determined by linear equalities and inequalities. I characterize clinical and public-health decision making using the minimax-regret criterion. A simple analytical solution exists when T = 2 and computation is tractable when T is larger.",['Charles F. Manski'],31305
92,Creating and Connecting US and China Science: Chinese Diaspora and Returnee Researchers,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31306,2023-06-01,"The close connection between US and China in scientific research and education in the 2000s produced a large group of China-born researchers who work in the US (“diaspora”) and a larger group of China-born researchers who gained US-research experience and returned to do their research in China (“returnee”).  Analyzing 2018 Scopus data on research papers, we estimate that diaspora researchers contributed to 27% of US addressed papers, and that returnee researchers contributed to 38% of China addressed papers.  Both the number of papers with diaspora authors and the number of papers with returnee authors far exceeded the usual measure of US-China collaborative work, papers with both US and China addresses.  In terms of quality or impact, papers with diaspora or returnee authors averaged more citations and had higher proportions of publication in high CiteScore journals than other US-addressed or China-addressed papers.  Finally, papers with diaspora and/or returnee authors were at the center of the US-China coauthor network and major conduits of research findings between the countries in the network of scientific citations. The benefits of the US-China research connection notwithstanding, the link between the countries’ research began to fray from 2018 through the early 2020s, with potential deleterious effects on each country’s future research output and on global science writ large to which US and China are the two biggest contributors.","['Qingnan Xie', 'Richard B.

98,"Carbon Border Adjustments, Climate Clubs, and Subsidy Races When Climate Policies Vary",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31310,2023-06-01,"Jurisdictions adopt heterogeneous climate policies that vary both in terms of ambition and in terms of policy approach, with some jurisdictions pricing carbon and others subsidizing clean production. We distinguish two types of policy spillovers associated with diverse policy approaches to climate change. First, when countries have different levels of climate ambition, free-riders will benefit at the expense of more committed countries. Second, when countries pursue different approaches, carbon-intensive producers within cost-imposing jurisdictions will be at a relative competitive disadvantage compared with producers in subsidizing jurisdictions. Carbon border adjustments and climate clubs are attempts to respond to these policy spillovers, but when countries have divergent policy approaches, one policy alone will not be able to address both types of spillovers. We also consider the policy dynamics that result from carbon border adjustments and climate clubs; both have the potential to encourage upward harmonization of climate policy, but they come with risks. Further, the pressures of international competition in the presence of divergent climate policy approaches may result in subsidy races, which come with their own potential risks and benefits.","['Kimberly A.

97,Misallocation in Firm Production: A Nonparametric Analysis Using Procurement Lotteries,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31311,2023-06-01,"How costly is the misallocation of production that we might expect to result from distortions such as market power, incomplete contracts, taxes, regulations, or corruption? This paper develops new tools for the study of misallocation that place minimal assumptions on firms' underlying technologies and behavior. We show how features of the distribution of marginal products can be identified from exogenous variation in firms' input use, and how these features can be used both to test for misallocation and to quantify the welfare losses that it causes.  We then consider an application in which thousands of firms experience demand shocks derived from a lottery-based assignment of public procurement contracts for construction services in Ecuador. Using administrative tax data about these firms, we reject the null of efficiency but estimate that the welfare losses resulting from misallocation are only 1.6% relative to the first-best. Standard parametric assumptions applied to the same setting would suggest losses that are at least an order of magnitude larger.","['Paul Carrillo', 'Dave Donaldson', 'Dina Pomeranz', 'Monica Singhal']",31311
99,When Cryptomining Comes to Town: High Electricity-use Spillovers to the Local Economy,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31312,2023-06-01,"Cryptomining, the clearing of cryptocurrency transactions, uses large quantities of electricity. We document that cryptominers' use of local electricity implies higher electricity prices for existing small businesses and households. Studying the electricity market in Upstate NY and using the Bitcoin price as an exogenous shifter of the part of the supply curve faced by the community, we estimate the electricity demand functions for small businesses and households. Based on our estimates, we calculate counterfactual electricity bills, finding that small businesses and households paid an extra $92 million and $204 million annually in Upstate NY because of increased electricity consumption from cryptominers. Local governments in Upstate NY realize more business taxes, but this only offsets a small portion of the costs from higher community electricity bills. Using data on China, where electricity prices are fixed, we find that rationing of electricity in cities with cryptomining entrants deteriorates wages and investments, consistent with crowding-out effects on the local economy. Our results point to a yet-unstudied negative spillover from technology processing to local communities, which would need to be considered against welfare benefits.","['Matteo Benetton', 'Giovanni Compiani', 'Adair Morse']",31312
55,Cassatts in the Attic,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31316,2023-06-01,"We analyze more than 70 million scientific articles to characterize the gender dynamics of commercializing science. The double-digit gender gap we report is explained neither by the quality of the science nor its ex-ante commercial potential, and is widest among papers with female last authors (i.e., lab heads) when publishing high-quality science. Using Pitchbook database, we show that when authors self-commercialize scientific discoveries via new ventures, no gap appears, raising the question of whether incumbent firms are unaware of—or ignore—scientific contributions by women. A natural experiment based on the Obama administration’s staggered introduction of open-access requirements for federally-funded research reveals that although easier access to scientific articles might facilitate commercialization, this benefit accrues primarily to male authors. Articles written with more “boastful” language are commercialized more often, and female scientists generally boast less, but even when they do their discoveries are commercialized no more often. We also observe gender homophily between scientific authors and commercializing inventors, the majority of whom are male. We conclude with the potential welfare effects of the gender gap: the disparity is more pronounced for higher-quality discoveries, as indicated by academic and patent citations or by predicted probabilities of commercialization derived from deep-learning algorithms.","['Marlène Koffi', 'Matt Marx']",31316
82,Are Cryptos Different? Evidence from Retail Trading,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31317,2023-06-01,"Trading in cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly over the last decade, primarily dominated by retail investors. Using a dataset of 200,000 retail traders from eToro, we show that they have a different model of the underlying price dynamics in cryptocurrencies relative to other assets. Retail traders in our sample are contrarian in stocks and gold, yet the same traders follow a momentum-like strategy in cryptocurrencies. Individual characteristics do not explain the differences in how people trade cryptocurrencies versus stocks, suggesting that our results are orthogonal to differences in investor composition or clientele effects. Furthermore, our findings are not explained by inattention, differences in fees, or preference for lotterylike stocks. We conjecture that retail investors hold a model of cryptocurrency prices, where price changes imply a change in the likelihood of future widespread adoption, which in turn pushes asset prices further in the same direction.","['Shimon Kogan', 'Igor Makarov', 'Marina Niessner', 'Antoinette Schoar']",31317

I take it to Brazilian data for 1998 and 2012 and find that (i) supply and demand shocks increase sorting of high-wage workers to high-wage firms, (ii) increased entry of high-wage firms boosts the effect of rising schooling attainment on mean log wages by 25%, and (iii) the minimum wage reduces formal wage inequality but also causes wage loss for mid-productivity workers and disemployment for those at the very bottom.",['Daniel Haanwinckel'],31318
62,The Changing Firm and Country Boundaries of US Manufacturers in Global Value Chains,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31319,2023-06-01,"This paper documents how US firms organize goods production across firm and country boundaries.  Most US firms that perform physical transformation tasks in-house using foreign manufacturing plants in 2007 also own US manufacturing plants; moreover manufacturing comprises their main domestic activity.  By contrast, “factoryless goods producers” outsource all physical transformation tasks to arm's-length contractors, focusing their in-house efforts on design and marketing.  This distinct firm type is missing from standard analyses of manufacturing, growing in importance, and increasingly reliant on foreign suppliers.  Physical transformation “within-the-firm” thus coincides with substantial physical transformation “within-the-country,” whereas its performance “outside-the-firm” often also implies “outside-the-country.” Despite these differences, factoryless goods producers and firms with foreign and domestic manufacturing plants both employ relatively high shares of US knowledge workers.  These patterns call for new models and data to capture the potential for foreign production to support domestic innovation, which US firms leverage around the world.",['Teresa C. Fort'],31319

ESG tilts are significant at both the extensive margin (which stocks are held) and the intensive margin (weights on stocks held). The latter tilts are larger. Institutions divest from brown stocks more by reducing positions than by eliminating them. The industry tilts increasingly toward green stocks, due to only the largest institutions. Other institutions and households tilt increasingly toward brown stocks. UNPRI signatories tilt greener; banks tilt browner.","['Lubos Pastor', 'Robert F. Stambaugh', 'Lucian A. Taylor']",31320

To help assess and potentially strengthen the credibility of such quantitative predictions we introduce  an IV-based goodness-of-fit measure that provides the basis for testing causal predictions in arbitrary general-equilibrium environments as well as for estimating the average misspecification in these predictions. As an illustration of how to use our IV-based goodness-of-fit measure in practice, we revisit the welfare consequences of Trump's trade war predicted by Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal (2020).","['Rodrigo Adão', 'Arnaud Costinot', 'Dave Donaldson']",31321
64,Incentive Pay and Social Returns to Worker Effort in Public Programs: Evidence from the Weatherization Assistance Program,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31322,2023-06-01,"Aligning compensation with recipient outcomes has the potential to improve the efficiency of government programs. We perform a field experiment to evaluate the impact of performance bonuses on the returns to spending in a large low-income energy efficiency assistance program. We find that performance-based bonuses dramatically increased program natural gas savings by 24%. The bonuses generate $5.39-$14.53 in social benefits for every dollar invested and increase the social net benefits from home-level weatherization more than two-fold. Contractors performing at high quality at baseline respond disproportionately to the incentives, suggesting that gains in the program's cost-effectiveness result from more efficient allocation of worker effort across workers who differ in their marginal effort cost. We do not find evidence of learning within the two-year study period or of increased deficiencies among non-incentivized tasks.","['Peter Christensen', 'Paul Francisco', 'Erica Myers']",31322
83,Anticipating Climate Change Across the United States,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31323,2023-06-01,"We evaluate how anticipation and adaptation shape the aggregate and local costs of climate change. We develop a dynamic spatial model of the U.S. economy and its 3,143 counties that features costly forward-looking migration and capital investment decisions. Recent methodological advances that leverage the `Master Equation' representation of the economy make the model tractable. We estimate the county-level impact of severe storms and heat waves over the 20th century on local income, population, and investment. The estimated impact of storms matches that of capital depreciation shocks in the model, while heat waves resemble combined amenity and productivity shocks. We then estimate migration and investment elasticities, as well as the structural damage functions, by matching these reduced-form results in our framework. Our findings show, first, that the impact of climate on capital depreciation magnifies the U.S. aggregate welfare costs of climate change twofold to nearly 5in 2023 under a business-as-usual warming scenario. Second, anticipation of future climate damages amplifies climate-induced worker and investment mobility, as workers and capitalists foresee the slow build-up of climate change. Third, migration reduces substantially the spatial variance in the welfare impact of climate change. Although both anticipation and migration are important for local impacts, their effect on aggregate U.S. losses from climate change is small.","['Adrien Bilal', 'Esteban Rossi-Hansberg']",31323

Our estimates are based on instruments that induce exogenous variation in roof appropriateness to PV installation. We find that PV adoption had a strong positive effect on Green Party votes. The effect is connected to the direct engagement of households with the PV system and does not reflect reciprocity to economic gains from PV.

To do so, we leverage a unique combination of worker resume and job postings datasets to measure firm-level AI investments and workforce composition variables, such as educational attainment, specialization, and hierarchy. We document that firms with higher initial shares of highly-educated workers and STEM workers invest more in AI. As firms invest in AI, they tend to transition to more educated workforces, with higher shares of workers with undergraduate and graduate degrees, and more specialization in STEM fields and IT skills. Furthermore, AI investments are associated with a flattening of the firms' hierarchical structure, with significant increases in the share of workers at the junior level and decreases in shares of workers in middle-management and senior roles. Overall, our results highlight that adoption of AI technologies is associated with significant reorganization of firms' workforces.","['Tania Babina', 'Anastassia Fedyk', 'Alex X.

Quantum annealers attempt to solve an NP-hard problem by starting in a quantum superposition of all states and generating candidate global solutions in milliseconds, irrespective of problem size. Using existing quantum hardware, we achieve an order-of-magnitude speed-up in solving the real business cycle model over benchmarks in the literature.

Negative growth responses to global temperature at longer horizons are found for all Group of Seven countries while positive responses are found for seven of the nine poorest countries. Global temperature shocks have negative effects on growth for around half of the countries and seemingly anomalous positive effects for the other half. After controlling for latitude and average temperature, positive growth responses to global temperature shocks are more likely for countries that are poorer, have experienced slower growth, are less educated (lower high school attainment), less open to trade, and more authoritarian.","['Kimberly A.

We calculate the total human capital returns of the expansion at above $100,000 per charter school enrollee. We further show that competition drives the aggregate gains; test score impacts on students induced into charter schools by the policy are negative.","['Michael Gilraine', 'Uros Petronijevic', 'John D.

52,Corporate Discount Rates,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31329,2023-06-01,"Standard theory implies that the discount rates used by firms in investment decisions (i.e., their required returns to capital) determine investment and transmit financial shocks to the real economy. However, there exists little evidence on how firms’ discount rates change over time and affect investment. We construct a new global database based on manual entry from conference calls. We show that, on average, firms move their discount rates with the cost of capital, but the relation is far below the one- to-one mapping assumed by standard theory, with substantial heterogeneity across firms. This pattern leads to time-varying wedges between discount rates and the cost of capital. The average wedge has increased substantially over the last decades as the cost of capital has dropped. Future investment is negatively related to discount rates and discount rate wedges, but only weakly related to the cost of capital because of the limited transmission into discount rates. Moreover, the large and growing discount rate wedges can account for the puzzle of “missing investment” (relative to high asset prices) in recent decades. We find that beliefs about value creation combined with market power, along with fluctuations in risk, explain changes in discount rate wedges over time.","['Niels Joachim Gormsen', 'Kilian Huber']",31329
54,The Demand for Mobility: Evidence from an Experiment with Uber Riders,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31330,2023-06-01,"Optimal transportation policies depend on demand elasticities that interact across modes and vary across the population, but understanding how and why these elasticities vary has been an empirical challenge. Using an experiment with Uber in Egypt, we randomly assign large price discounts for transport services over a 3 month period to examine: (1) the demand for ride-hailing services, (2) the demand for total mobility (km/week), and (3) its contributions to external costs (e.g. congestion). A 50% discount more than quadruples Uber usage and induces an increase of nearly 49% in total mobility.

51,The Confederate Diaspora,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31331,2023-06-01,"This paper shows how white migration out of the postbellum South diffused and entrenched Confederate culture across the United States at a critical juncture of westward expansion and postwar reconciliation. These migrants laid the groundwork for Confederate symbols and racial norms to become pervasive nationally in the early 20th century. Occupying positions of authority, former slaveholders played an outsized role in this process. Beyond memorializing the Confederacy, migrants exacerbated racial violence, boosted novel forms of exclusion, and compounded Black disadvantage outside the South. Moving West, former Confederates had larger effects in frontier communities lacking established culture and institutions. Over time, they continued to transmit norms to their children and non-Southern neighbors. The diaspora legacy persists over the long run, shaping racial inequities in labor, housing, and policing. Together, our findings offer a new perspective on migration, elite influence, and the interplay between culture and institutions in the nation-building process.","['Samuel Bazzi', 'Andreas Ferrara', 'Martin Fiszbein', 'Thomas P.

For the next 15 years, the gender gap in median earnings among full-time, full-year workers changed little, leading many scholars and advocates to conclude the legislation was ineffectual. This paper uses two different research designs to show that women’s relative wages grew rapidly in the aftermath of this legislation. The data show little evidence of short-term changes in women’s employment, but some results suggest that firms reduced their hiring and promotion of women in the medium term.","['Martha J.

Using a new dynamic bunching approach we estimate the average response to the reform, the share of compliers, and the local average treatment effect. The annual wealth growth rate of treated taxpayers falls by 0.5 percentage points after the reform. This decline is likely due to increased evasion, as suggested by the sharp responses in self-reported wealth but not in third-party-reported incomes. The wealth tax base becomes more elastic post reform, illustrating the key role of information policy choices for tax base elasticities.","['Bertrand Garbinti', 'Jonathan Goupille-Lebret', 'Mathilde Muñoz', 'Stefanie Stantcheva', 'Gabriel Zucman']",31333

Investigating the Department of Labor’s 1899 Hand and Machine Labor Study using causal inference statistical techniques, we show the adoption of inanimate power did indeed induce deskilling. While the effects were statistically significant, they accounted for only 7-15 percent of the deskilling observed in the sample. Broadening the scope of our inquiry, we find the increased division of labor as captured by the increase in scale of operations and the ratio of workers to tasks accounts for a larger fraction.","['Jeremy Atack', 'Robert A.

Consistent with standard practice for training investments within firms, we asked middle managers -- who sit above supervisors in the hierarchy -- to nominate members of their supervisory team for training. Program access was randomized within these recommendation rankings. Highly recommended supervisors experienced no productivity gains; in contrast, less-recommended supervisors' productivity increased 12% relative to controls. This was not due to poor information or favoritism. Instead, consistent with the fact that supervisor turnover comes at a large effort cost to middle managers due to gaps in coverage and onboarding, middle managers prioritized retention over productivity impacts. Indeed, treated supervisors were 15% less likely to quit than controls; this gain was most pronounced for highly recommended supervisors. Misallocation of training can help explain the persistence of low managerial quality in firms.","['Achyuta Adhvaryu', 'Emir Murathanoglu', 'Anant Nyshadham']",31335

We analyze the effects of introducing these new billing codes. First, we provide evidence on the adoption of the new codes by primary care physicians. We show that take-up of the new billing codes occurs gradually and exhibits substantial variation across space and across physician characteristics. Second, we provide evidence on how the new billing codes can both complement and substitute for the billing or provision of other services. We focus on two case studies. As a case of code substitution, we show that Transitional Care Management services partially crowd out traditional office visits following hospital discharges. As a case of code complementarity, we show that both Transitional Care Management and Chronic Care Management services predict increases in annual wellness visits. Overall, our analysis highlights how both new code take-up frictions and the impact of new code billing on existing code billing can be important for assessing the total costs and benefits of payment reforms.","['Jeffrey Clemens', 'Jonathan M.

Yet many low-income households face severe challenges in maintaining stable housing. In this paper we examine the impact of the 2021 temporary expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) on the living arrangements and housing affordability of families with low incomes. We employ a parameterized difference-in-differences method and use national data from a sample of parents who are receiving, or recently received, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (N~20,500). We find that the monthly CTC is associated with a higher likelihood that parents reported a change in their living arrangements as well as reduced household size, an effect largely driven by fewer mothers living with a partner (and not a reduction in doubling up). We also find that the credit reduced parents’ likelihood of reporting potential moves due to difficulties affording rent/mortgages as well as the amount and incidence of back-owed rent/mortgages. We find some differences in effects by race and ethnicity and income. Our findings illustrate how the monthly credit allowed parents to gain residential independence from partners, reduce the number of people residing in their household, and reduce their past-due rent/mortgage.","['Natasha V.

We analyze the effects on child vaccinations of a large-scale community-based health worker program that aimed to reach remote areas distant from public health facilities in Madagascar. We identify these effects using a triple-difference design that leverages the time and geographic variation in the program rollout and the geocoded household distance to the closest health facility. Our findings indicate that, on average, the program did not improve the vaccination uptake in treated areas; however, the community health workers component had an additional effect on children’s vaccinations in the most remote areas from the closest health facility. Despite this improvement, we find that mothers’ religious affiliation might constitute a barrier for the vaccination uptake of the most remote and vulnerable children.","['Catalina Herrera-Almanza', 'Maria Rosales-Rueda']",31340

Techies are STEM-skill intensive and are associated with innovation, as well as with technology adoption, management, and diffusion within firms. Using structural econometric methods, we estimate the causal effect of techies on firm-level Hicks-neutral productivity in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries. We find that techies raise firm-level productivity, and this effect goes beyond the employment of R&D workers, extending to ICT and other techies. In non-manufacturing firms, the impact of techies on productivity operates mostly through ICT and other techies, not R&D workers. Engineers have a greater effect on productivity than technicians.","['James Harrigan', 'Ariell Reshef', 'Farid Toubal']",31341

Beginning in 2020, policy responses led to a surge in Medicaid enrollment due to federal rules preventing Medicaid disenrollment, and total Medicaid enrollment increased more from January 2020-2023 than the net increase in insurance coverage from 2013-2017 following the Affordable Care Act’s implementation. As these policies come to an end, it is crucial to understand their implications for the future of Medicaid. This paper provides an overview of Medicaid’s enrollment, renewal and funding policies, highlighting how these policies changed during and immediately following the acute phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, describes enrollment increases and their composition, reviews literature relevant to the policy and its unwinding, and identifies key areas for research. By examining this unprecedented period of Medicaid policy, we can inform future policy decisions and optimize safety net programs to be effective in a broad set of circumstances.","['Laura Dague', 'Benjamin D.

Previous research has shown, for example, that the top income quintile receives 60% of subsidies for rooftop solar and 90% of subsidies for electric vehicles. This paper finds that heat pumps are an important exception. Using newly available U.S. nationally representative data, the paper finds that there is remarkably little correlation between heat pump adoption and household income. Nationwide, 15% of U.S. households have a heat pump as their primary heating equipment, and adoption levels are essentially identical for all income levels ranging from the bottom of the income distribution (<$30,000 annually) to the top ($150,000+).

We quantify this housing wealth channel using an overlapping generations model with neighborhood choice, spatial equilibrium, and endogenous school quality. Housing market shocks in the model generate large intra- and intergenerational wealth effects, with the latter accounting for over half of total wealth effects.","['Michael Gilraine', 'James Graham', 'Angela Zheng']",31345

We consider all Ph.D. students in STEM graduating between 2000 and 2014, after the recent systematic introduction of doctoral programs in this country. We investigate the joint effects of gender and race for the whole sample and looking separately at the sub-samples of (1) white-white; (2) black-black; and (3) black-white student-advisor couples. We find significant productivity differences between male and female students. These disparities are more pronounced for female students working with male advisors when looking at the joint effects of gender and race for the white-white and black-black student-advisor pairs. We also explore whether publication productivity differences change significantly for students with a high, medium, or low “productivity-profile”. We find that female productivity gaps are U-shaped over the range of productivity. Female students working with male advisors have more persistent productivity gaps over the productivity distribution, while female students with a high (or low) “productivity-profile” studying with female advisors are as productive as male students with similar “productivity-profile” studying with male advisors.","['Giulia Rossello', 'Robin Cowan', 'Jacques Mairesse']",31346
79,A Theory of Price Caps on Non-Renewable Resources,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31347,2023-06-01,"In December 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a G7-led coalition of countries imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on the sales of Russian oil that use western services. This paper provides a theoretical and quantitative analysis of this new tool. We build a tractable equilibrium model in which the financially constrained exporter of a non-renewable resource optimally exerts market power, and the price of the resource varies stochastically. An important insight from this framework is that the supply curve is inelastic and can even be downward sloping, rationalizing the patterns we observe in the data. Contrary to the fears that an introduction of the price cap will cause a damaging oil supply shock, the exporter may have strong incentives to increase extraction following the introduction of a binding price cap. In fact, when the producer is large and has market power, a price cap that applies to all or most sales significantly limits the degree to which market power is used in equilibrium and stabilizes world oil prices. But if the cap is poorly enforced, or if the sanctioned state has access to a non-compliant “shadow” fleet, the cap is less effective at stabilizing world prices.","['Simon Johnson', 'Lukasz Rachel', 'Catherine Wolfram']",31347

75,Optimal Paternalism in a Population with Bounded Rationality,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31349,2023-06-01,"A central mission of public economics has been to determine policies that optimize utilitarian welfare. To improve the realism of policy evaluation, it is desirable to enrich understanding of behavior and develop methods of analysis that use the enriched understanding to assess policies. Attention has been given to recognition that behavior may be boundedly rational, but little has been done to draw the implications of this work for mechanism design. Behavioral economists have suggested that planners should limit the choices available to individuals or should frame the options in a manner thought to influence choice, but the discussion has commonly been verbal and casual. We formally consider a planner who has the power to design a discrete choice set from which individuals will choose. We suppose that individuals may be boundedly rational and, hence, may not maximize utility. Our concern is realistic settings in which persons have heterogeneous preferences and may vary in how their choices deviate from utility maximization. We find that optimal paternalism is subtle. The policy that most effectively constrains or influences individual choices depends on the distribution of preferences and the choice probabilities measuring the extent to which persons behave suboptimally, conditional on their preferences.","['Charles F.

Even most of the superstar firms start their business life small and then grow over time. Small firms have less internal resources, which makes them more fragile and sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. This suggests the need for frequent and real-time monitoring of the small business sector’s health. Previously this was difficult due to a lack of appropriate data. This paper fills this important gap by developing a new Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index that focuses on the smallest of small businesses with at most 9 workers in the US and the UK and at most 19 workers in Canada. The Index aggregates a sample of anonymous QuickBooks Online Payroll subscriber data (QBO Payroll sample) from 333,000 businesses in the US, 66,000 in Canada, and 25,000 in the UK. After comparing the QBO Payroll sample data to the official statistics, we remove the seasonal components and use a Flexible Least Squares method to calibrate the QBO Payroll sample data against official statistics. Finally, we use the estimated model and the QBO Payroll sample data to generate a near real-time index of economic activity. We show that the estimated model performs well both in-sample and out-of-sample. Additionally, we use this analysis for different regions and industries.","['Ufuk Akcigit', 'Raman Singh Chhina', 'Seyit M.

Second, we show that a minimalist Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model with a parsimonious TFP catch-up process can account for China's growth path and the growth paths of other East Asia economies at a similar stage of development. The growth paths of other East Asia economies and the model predictions suggest that China's growth will substantially slow, so much so that we find the U.S. growth rate will likely be higher than China's by 2043. We also find that China's income per capita will level off at roughly 44% of the U.S. level around 2100.","['Jesús Fernández-Villaverde', 'Lee E. Ohanian', 'Wen Yao']",31351

Working with construction companies and the UAE Ministry of Labor, we randomized job offers to potential migrant workers at recruitment sites. We measured effects on labor market outcomes, well-being, social relationships, and work satisfaction, as well as on labor intermediation costs, assets and debt. We find that workers who received the randomized offer experienced 30% higher earnings, and those who take up the offer to migrate to the UAE doubled their compensation. However, they also paid substantial upfront costs to labor intermediaries, financed by additional debt, that reduced take-home pay by about 10%. Migrants also reported a significant fall in subjective well-being, driven by increases in physical pain, effort, and heat. There were no significant effects on loneliness or other dimensions of well-being. Our finding of negative effects on well-being is consistent with the large share of workers offered jobs who did not migrate to the UAE. Extrapolating using a linear marginal treatment effects framework to workers who decline the UAE job offer, we find large and positive pecuniary returns to migration, even including intermediary fees, but even larger non-pecuniary costs.","['Suresh Naidu', 'Yaw Nyarko', 'Shing-Yi Wang']",31354

The amplitude of responses to global conditions like risk sentiment, discussed in the context of the global financial cycle, depends on the characteristics and vulnerabilities of the institutions providing funding flows. Evidence from across empirical approaches and using granular data provides policy-relevant lessons. International spillovers of monetary policy and risk sentiment through global liquidity evolve in response to regulation, the characteristics of financial institutions, and actions of official institutions around liquidity provision. Strong prudential policies in the home countries of global banks and official facilities reduce funding strains during stress events. Country-specific policy challenges, summarized by the monetary and financial trilemmas, are partially alleviated.

In contrast, agricultural investment and long-run productivity increase more in drought-exposed areas when they have access to bank finance, even allowing some of these areas to leapfrog otherwise similar areas in the subsequent decades.

This is particularly the case for occupations with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers. This evidence is in line with the Skill Biased Technological Change theory. While there exists heterogeneity across countries, only very few countries show a decline in employment shares of occupations more exposed to AI-enabled automation. Country heterogeneity for this result seems to be linked to the pace of technology diffusion and education, but also to the level of product market regulation (competition) and employment protection laws. In contrast to the findings for employment, we find little evidence for a relationship between wages and potential exposures to new technologies.","['Stefania Albanesi', 'António Dias da Silva', 'Juan F.

In recent decades, trade integration between advanced economies increased rapidly while average GDP correlations remained stable. We show that structural change – trend reallocation of economic activity towards services – plays an important part in resolving this apparent puzzle. Business cycle shocks in the service sector are less internationally correlated than in manufacturing, and thus structural change lowers GDP comovement by increasing the share of less correlated sectors in GDP. Globalization – trend reductions in trade costs – exerts two opposing effects on cross-border GDP comovement. On the one hand, greater trade linkages increase international transmission of shocks and therefore comovement. On the other, globalization induces structural change towards services because it reduces the relative price of traded goods, and services and goods are complements. We use a multi-country, multi-sector model of international production and trade to quantify these effects. The two opposing effects of globalization on comovement largely cancel each other out, limiting the net contribution of globalization to increasing international comovement over this period.","['Barthélémy Bonadio', 'Zhen Huo', 'Andrei A.

The program cancels between $5,000 and $17,500 in debt for teachers who remain employed in a high-need school for five consecutive years. Using both quasi-experimental evidence and a randomized control trial, we find that neither eligibility nor a targeted information intervention result in changes in teacher employment decisions, despite the presence of sizable student loan balances in our sample. Information was found, however, to increase application and receipt rates for teachers who had already accrued the five years of eligibility. Additional evidence from contingent valuation surveys suggests that teachers do in general value possible debt relief. Incorporating qualitative evidence from focus groups, we conclude that take-up may be constrained by program complexity and administrative barriers that involve knowing which schools qualify, tracking employment records, having employers sign off, and coordinating with loan servicers.","['Brian Jacob', 'Damon Jones', 'Benjamin J.

45,Fatal Errors: The Mortality Value of Accurate Weather Forecasts,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31361,2023-06-01,"We provide the first revealed preference estimates of the benefits of routine weather forecasts. The benefits come from how people use advance information to reduce mortality from heat and cold.  Theoretically, more accurate forecasts reduce mortality if and only if mortality risk is convex in forecast errors. We test for such convexity using data on the universe of mortality events and weather forecasts for a twelve-year period in the U.S. Results show that erroneously mild forecasts increase mortality whereas erroneously extreme forecasts do not reduce mortality.  Making forecasts 50% more accurate would save 2,200 lives per year.  The public would be willing to pay $112 billion to make forecasts 50% more accurate over the remainder of the century, of which $22 billion reflects how forecasts facilitate adaptation to climate change.","['Jeffrey G.

46,Global Value Chains and Labor Standards: The Race-to-the-Bottom Problem.,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31362,2023-06-01,"We ask how globalization affects a government's incentives to set labor standards for its workers.  In a stylized equilibrium model of global value chains, we find two contrasting results.  First, each country chooses stricter labor standards with globalization than it would under autarky, because labor standards are a normal good and the general increase in incomes from globalization increases demand for them.  We call this the effect of `globalization in the large.'  Second, if more countries join the world economy so that globalization increases at the margin, labor standards worsen (improve) at the margin if a country is competing with countries that are very similar to (different from) itself.  We call this the effect of `globalization at the margin.'  In equilibrium, labor standards are actually stricter than optimal because each country is able to pass some of the costs of its improved labor standards onto other countries (consumers of the final good, for example).","['Hyejoon Im', 'John McLaren']",31362

Each government must trade off the direct benefit of stronger bargaining rights against both the effect of chasing multinationals away to rival countries and general-equilibrium effects of discouraging investment in the industry altogether. We find that an increase in globalization in the sense of lower transaction costs has no effect on equilibrium workers' rights, but adding more countries to the global trading system tends, in the limit, to weaken them. Thus, as a matter of theory, the effect of globalization on labor rights is ambiguous. Empirically, we find little evidence that globalization drives movements in labor rights in either direction.","['Hyejoon Im', 'John McLaren']",31363

The Trade-Off between Administrative Ordeals and Fraud",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31364,2023-06-01,"Screening requirements are common features of fraud and corruption mitigation efforts around the world. Yet imposing these requirements involves trade-offs between higher administrative costs, delayed benefits, and exclusion of genuine beneficiaries on one hand and lower fraud on the other. We examine these trade-offs in one of the largest economic relief programs in US history: the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Employing a database that includes nearly 11.5 million PPP loans, we assess the impact of  screening by exploiting temporal variation in the documentation standards applied to loan applications for loans of different values. We find that  screening significantly reduced the incidence and magnitude of various measures of loan irregularities that are indicative of fraud. Moreover, our analysis reveals that a subset of borrowers with a checkered history strategically reduced their loan application amounts in order to avoid being subjected to  screening. Borrowers without a checkered history engaged in this behavior at a much lower rate, implying that the documentation requirement reduced fraud without imposing an undue administrative burden on legitimate firms. All told, our estimates imply that screening led to a reduction in losses due to fraud equal to at least $744 million.","['Shan Aman-Rana', 'Daniel W. Gingerich', 'Sandip Sukhtankar']",31364

Drawing on the model, the paper surveys papers that examine the net effects of coal on the growth in city population and air pollution on health. The paper then turns to papers that explicitly consider the trade-offs between production benefits and pollution disamenities across space and over time.

Examining local income inequality across U.S. regions, the data suggest that such spillovers exist for physicians, dentists, and real estate agents.

In a two-step experiment of an agronomy training program among Rwandan coffee farmers, we first randomize the concentration of trainees at the village level and then randomly select within each village. Knowledge increased, and yields were 6.7% higher for trained farmers.

These choices, in turn, depend on individual preferences for waiting times, travel times, and transfers. We study these tradeoffs by examining the world's largest bus rapid transit system, in Jakarta, Indonesia, leveraging a large network expansion between 2016-2020. Using detailed ridership data and aggregate travel flows from smartphone data, we analyze how new direct connections, changes in bus travel time, and wait time reductions increase ridership and overall trips. We set up and estimate a transit network demand model with multi-dimensional travel costs, idiosyncratic heterogeneity induced by random wait times, and inattention, matching event-study moments from the route launches. Commuters in Jakarta are 2-4 times more sensitive to wait time compared to time on the bus, and inattentive to long routes. To study the implications for network design, we introduce a new framework to describe the set of optimal networks. Our results suggest that a less concentrated network would increase ridership and commuter welfare.","['Gabriel Kreindler', 'Arya Gaduh', 'Tilman Graff', 'Rema Hanna', 'Benjamin A. Olken']",31369

Using a panel survey of workers followed through age 60, I show that growth in the college wage premium is primarily explained by occupational sorting. Shortly after graduating, workers with college degrees shift into professional, nonroutine occupations with much greater returns to tenure. Nearly 90 percent of life cycle wage growth occurs within rather than between jobs. To understand these patterns, I develop a model of human capital investment where workers differ in learning ability and jobs vary in complexity. Faster learners complete more education and sort into complex jobs with greater returns to investment. College acts as a gateway to professional occupations, which offer more opportunity for wage growth through on-the-job learning.",['David J. Deming'],31373

28,Who Benefits from a Smaller Honors Track?,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31375,2023-06-01,"Most U.S. high school courses separate classrooms into standard and honors tracks. This paper characterizes the efficiency and distributional impact of changing the share of students enrolling in honors classrooms.  Using a sorting model where students choose tracks by course but schools influence the share choosing honors, we show that administrators’ optimal choices of honors track size require knowledge of treatment effect functions capturing the impact of alternative honors enrollment shares on different parts of the student predicted performance distribution. Using administrative data from North Carolina public high schools, we estimate these treatment effect functions by predicted performance quintile.  Across various specifications, we find that smaller honors tracks (20%-30% of students) yield moderate performance gains for the top quintile (~.05-.07 test score SDs relative to no tracking) that decline monotonically across quintiles toward zero for the bottom quintile.  However,  expanding the honors share beyond 30-35% generates further (small) achievement increases only for the middle quintile, while reducing top quintile gains and causing substantial bottom quintile losses. Since many courses feature honors shares above 35% or do not track, we predict that enrolling ~25% of students in honors in each high school course would improve all quintiles’ statewide performance.","['Zachary Szlendak', 'Richard K.

29,A Welfare Analysis of Tax Audits Across the Income Distribution,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31376,2023-06-01,"We estimate the returns to IRS audits of taxpayers across the income distribution. We find an additional $1 spent auditing taxpayers above the 90th income percentile yields more than $12 in revenue, while audits of below-median income taxpayers yield $5. We draw upon comprehensive internal accounting information and audit-level enforcement logs to quantify the average costs and revenues associated with each audit. We begin by estimating the average initial return to all audits of US taxpayers filing in 2010-2014. On average, $1 in audit spending raises $2.17 in initial revenue. Audits of high-income taxpayers are more costly, but the additional revenue raised more than offsets the costs. Audits of the 99-99.9th percentile have a 3.2:1 return; audits of the top 0.1% return 6.3:1. We then exploit the 40% audit reduction between tax years 2010 and 2014 to examine the returns to marginal audits. We find they exceed the returns to average audits. Revenues remain relatively unchanged but marginal costs fall below average costs due to economies of scale. Next, we use randomly selected audits to examine the impact of an initial audit on future revenue. This specific deterrence effect produces at least three times more revenue than the initial audit. Deterrence effects are relatively consistent across the income distribution. This results in the 12:1 return above the 90th percentile. We conclude by estimating the welfare consequences of audits using the MVPF framework and comparing audits to other revenue raising policies. We find that audits raise revenue at lower welfare cost.","['William C. Boning', 'Nathaniel Hendren', 'Ben Sprung-Keyser', 'Ellen Stuart']",31376

Already there is growing evidence that the United States has insufficient transmission capacity, and current levels of annual investment are well below what would be required for a renewables-dominated system. We describe a variety of challenges that make it difficult to build new transmission and potential policy responses to mitigate them, as well as possible substitutes for some new transmission capacity.","['Lucas W.

We introduce an anticipated phased out reform into the model and relate the predicted path of sectoral and  aggregate activity to the data. Our multi-sector dynamic exporting model predicts much larger gains from these reforms than models that abstract from exporter dynamics, sectoral heterogeneity, trade in financial assets, or capital accumulation. It  also captures the key macroeconomic features in terms of a temporary expansion in growth featuring a large, but short-lived investment boom financed by international borrowing, more so when the reforms are expected to be short-lived.","['George A.

This paper studies the reaction of online banks to changes in federal fund rates. We find that these banks increase rates that they offer on deposits significantly more than traditional banks do. A 100 basis points increase in the federal fund rate leads to a 30 basis points larger increase in rates of online banks. Consistent with the rate movements, online bank deposits experience inflows, while traditional banks experience outflows during monetary tightening in 2022. The findings are consistent across banking markets of different competitiveness and demographics.

We undertake the first welfare analysis under reference-dependent preferences. We characterize the welfare impact of changes in reference points and prices, decomposing these into direct and behavioral effects. The sign of direct and behavioral effects depends on the form of reference-dependent payoffs; which of these effects matter for welfare depends on whether reference dependence reflects a bias or a normative preference. We derive sufficient statistics formulas quantifying the social welfare effects of changes in reference points and prices in terms of estimable reduced-form parameters and normative judgments. We illustrate these findings with an empirical application to reference dependence exhibited in German workers' retirement decisions. We find positive social welfare effects of increasing the Normal Retirement Age, but ambiguous effects of financial incentives to postpone retirement.","['Daniel Reck', 'Arthur Seibold']",31381

Our dataset encompasses product-level prices, costs, and output within the Belgian manufacturing sector over twenty years, recorded at a quarterly frequency. Leveraging the richness of the data, we adopt a “bottom-up” approach that identifies the Phillips curve’s slope by estimating the primitive parameters that govern firms’ pricing behavior, including the degrees of price rigidity and strategic complementarities in price setting. Our estimates indicate a high slope for the marginal cost-based Phillips curve, which contrasts with the low estimates of the conventional unemployment or output gap-based formulations in the literature. We reconcile the difference by showing that, although the pass-through of marginal cost into inflation is substantial, the elasticity of marginal cost in relation to the output gap is low. Furthermore, through an examination of the transmission of oil shocks, we illustrate how the marginal cost-based Phillips curve offers a transparent means of capturing the impact of supply shocks on inflation.","['Luca Gagliardone', 'Mark Gertler', 'Simone Lenzu', 'Joris Tielens']",31382

Using a unique dataset tracking emotions for a large sample of respondents from 2008 to 2017, we explore the relationship between anger and the populist vote share across U.S. counties. More angry counties displayed stronger preferences for populist candidates during the 2016 presidential primaries and elections. However, once we control for other negative emotions and life satisfaction, anger no longer operates as a separate channel in driving the populist vote share. Instead, our results indicate that a more complex sense of malaise and gloom, rather than anger per se, drives the rise in populism.","['Omer Ali', 'Klaus Desmet', 'Romain Wacziarg']",31383

The key identification insight is that other periods' treatment variables are instruments for the unobserved fixed effects.

We show that the common assumption that the return to unobserved teacher quality is the same for all students is rejected by the data. We also present evidence that No Child Left Behind-era school accountability increased the effectiveness of teacher quality for lower performing students.","['Jinyong Hahn', 'John D.

These treatments are benchmarked to versions of the speeches recorded by an actor to control for message content, and to non-ideological presidential speeches to control for leader priming.

There is no need to specify investor preferences. When fitted to match 10-year real US Treasury rates the model can replicate the salient fluctuations in the time series of gold prices since 2007. The model is also able to capture key patterns of CME Comex gold futures prices from about 1990 onwards.

Upon reentry, they face financial hardship, high rates of morbidity and mortality, and high incidence of re-offense. Medicaid coverage, as a means-tested transfer program providing subsidized health insurance, may influence reincarceration through both financial and health channels. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive look at the effects of public health insurance coverage on post-release behavior of formerly incarcerated adults. We study a natural experiment in which two separate state policy changes resulted in a 60 percentage point increase in Medicaid enrollment at release. Using a series of linked individual level administrative datasets, we estimate the effects of this change in Medicaid enrollment, finding declines in reincarceration, increased employment, and higher health care use. Leveraging data on financial concerns and need for mental health and substance use treatment to examine mechanisms, we find support for a financial channel and mixed support for health channels.

Our analysis illustrates how China's gradual policy reforms, amidst highly imperfect financial markets, have effectively helped spur GDP growth throughout its macroeconomic evolution. We highlight the tradeoffs between accelerating GDP growth and safeguarding China's long-term financial stability.","['Kaiji Chen', 'Tao Zha']",31395
7,Monetary Policy Transmission under Financial Repression,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31396,2023-06-01,"According to the conventional bank lending channel of monetary policy, wholesale funding in economies with well-developed financial markets moves negatively with retail deposits in response to changes in the monetary policy rate, thereby weakening the transmission of monetary policy. We present a theoretical model to demonstrate that in economies with financial repression, (i) retail deposits and wholesale funding comove positively in response to changes in the policy rate and (ii) wholesale funding strengthens, rather than weakens, the transmission of monetary policy to bank loans. We support these findings by bank-level evidence with deposit rate ceilings.","['Kaiji Chen', 'Yiqing Xiao', 'Tao Zha']",31396
1,How Costs Limit Contraceptive Use among Low-Income Women in the U.S.: A Randomized Control Trial,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31397,2023-06-01,"The Affordable Care Act eliminated cost-sharing for contraception for Americans with health insurance, but substantial cost sharing remains for uninsured individuals who seek care through Title X—a national family planning program that provides patient-centered, subsidized contraception and reproductive health services in the U.S. This paper uses a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine how cost-sharing at Title X providers affects the choice of contraceptive method. The study randomizes vouchers that cover any contraceptive method up to the cost of 50% or 100% of a name-brand intra-uterine device (IUD). The results show that Title X clients are highly constrained by the out-of-pocket costs of contraception. The offer of free contraception is associated with a 40% increase in the use of any birth control method (ITT effect), a 94% increase in the value of birth control purchased, a 328-day (226%) increase in the period covered by contraceptives purchased, and a 324% increase in the likelihood of choosing a long-acting, reversible method (an IUD or implant). The results imply that eliminating the costs of contraception for Title X clients nationwide would reduce undesired pregnancies by 5.3%, birth rates by 3.9%, and abortions by 8.3%, and save $1.43 billion in the first year of the program.","['Martha J.

9,How Do Firms Respond to State Retirement Plan Mandates?,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31398,2023-06-01,"This paper investigates the effect of state retirement plan mandates on the supply of employer-sponsored retirement plans (ESRPs) by firms. These policies require employers to either (1) offer ESRPs to workers or (2) facilitate automatic payroll deductions that are deposited into individual retirement accounts (IRAs) established for workers by the state. In this paper, we utilize individual-level data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and firm-level data from Form 5500 filings to examine the effect of these automatic-enrollment IRA (“auto-IRA”) policies on employer decisions to offer, and worker inclusion in, ESRPs. We exploit variation in the timing of implementation across states and firm size categories and estimate that auto-IRA policies increase the probability that an individual works for a firm with an ESRP by roughly 3 percent, and the probability that the individual participates in that ESRP by 33 percent. These policies also increase the number of ESRP participants at the average firm in our sample by 3-5 percent.","['Adam Bloomfield', 'Kyung Min Lee', 'Jay Philbrick', 'Sita Slavov']",31398
2,Exporting Ideology: The Right and Left of Foreign Influence,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31399,2023-06-01,"We present an economic rationale for countries resorting to foreign influence to export their ideology to other nations. Our model incorporates two fundamental elements: redistribution of the tax burden between capital owners and workers, and international capital mobility. The model highlights the role of ideology in shaping both the taxes implemented by governments and the cross-border externalities of these policy choices. Pro-capital governments set lower capital taxes than pro-labor governments. Importantly, pro-capital governments benefit from other countries setting low capital taxes, while pro-labor governments' efforts to shift the tax burden onto capital owners are facilitated by higher capital taxes abroad. These cross-border externalities create strong incentives for engaging in foreign influence activities. We solve for a political equilibrium in which incumbent governments may exert costly actions that probabilistically affect the electoral outcome in other countries. In equilibrium, pro-capital parties exert influence aimed at promoting pro-capital parties and policies worldwide, while pro-labor governments carry out foreign influence activities aimed at boosting pro-labor parties and policies in other countries.","['Pol Antràs', 'Gerard Padró I Miquel']",31399
21,Gender-Neutral Language and Gender Disparities,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31400,2023-06-01,"This study investigates empirically whether and how the use of gender-neutral language affects the performance of women and men in real high-stakes exams. We make use of a natural experiment in which the institute administering Israel’s standardized college admission tests amended the language used in its exams, making test language more gender neutral. We find that the change to a more gender-neutral language was associated with a significant improvement in the performance of women on quantitative questions, which meaningfully reduced the gender gap between male and female performance on these questions. However, the change did not affect female performance on verbal questions nor male performance on either quantitative or verbal questions. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gendered language may introduce a ""stereotype threat"" that adversely affects women’s performance in tasks in which they are stereotypically perceived to underperform. Our findings have significant implications for the ongoing academic and policy discussions regarding the use and effects of gender-neutral language.","['Alma Cohen', 'Tzur Karelitz', 'Tamar Kricheli-Katz', 'Sephi Pumpian', 'Tali Regev']",31400
