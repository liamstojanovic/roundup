Drawing on trade\u2011level regulatory data, we study the netting benefits for UK dealers if comprehensive central clearing had been introduced to the cash gilt and gilt repo markets ahead of the March 2020 dash for cash (DFC) crisis. For the gilt repo market, we estimate that the policy would have reduced the gilt repo exposures on UK dealers\u2019 balance sheets by 40% and, hence, boosted their aggregate leverage ratio by 3 basis points. If that policy had been accompanied by standardisation of repo maturity dates, such that they fell on the same day of the week (apart from for overnight repo), the reduction in exposures would have risen to 60% and the increase in the aggregate leverage ratio to 5 basis points. Such improvements in netting rates would in principle have allowed the dealers\u2019 repo desks to expand their trading during the DFC by 2.5 times more than under prevailing clearing rates for each incremental unit of capital available to them. For cash gilt trades, central clearing would only have reduced unsettled trade exposures for dealers using a particular accounting treatment, but would have done so by up to 80% for that group, boosting its aggregate leverage ratio by 0.4 basis points. However, changes to the computation of the Basel III leverage ratio implemented in January 2023 would also have had these effects on cash trades."],"Author":"Yuliya Baranova, Eleanor Holbrook, David MacDonald, William Rawstorne, Nicholas Vause and Georgia Waddington","Number":1026},{"Title":"Flexible Bayesian MIDAS: time\u2011variation, group\u2011shrinkage and\u00a0sparsity","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/flexible-bayesian-midas-time-variation-group-shrinkage-and-sparsity","Date":"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["We propose a mixed\u2011frequency regression prediction approach that models a time\u2011varying trend, stochastic volatility and fat tails in the variable of interest. The coefficients of high\u2011frequency indicators are regularised via a shrinkage prior that accounts for the grouping structure and within\u2011group correlation among lags. A new sparsification algorithm on the posterior motivated by Bayesian decision theory derives inclusion probabilities over lag groups, thus making the results easy to communicate without imposing sparsity a priori. An empirical application on nowcasting UK GDP growth suggests that group\u2011shrinkage in combination with the time\u2011varying components substantially increases nowcasting performance by reading signals from an economically meaningful subset of indicators, whereas the time\u2011varying components help by allowing the model to switch between indicators. Over the data release cycle, signals initially stem from survey data and then shift towards few \u2018hard\u2019 real activity indicators. During the Covid pandemic, the model performs relatively well since it shifts towards indicators for the service and housing sectors that capture the disruptions from economic lockdowns."],"Author":"David Kohns and Galina Potjagailo","Number":1025},{"Title":"Revisiting the monetary transmission mechanism through an industry\u2011level differential approach","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/revisiting-the-monetary-transmission-mechanism","Date":"Fri, 26 May 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["We combine industry\u2011level data on output and prices with monetary policy shock estimates for 105 countries to analyse how the effects of monetary policy vary with industry characteristics.

If delays apply uniformly to uninformed and informed traders, the level of delays does not affect information aggregation.

Therefore, the equilibrium fraction of informed traders is lower if delays are longer, establishing an inverse relationship between trading delays and price informativeness.

Exploiting heterogeneity in banks\u2019 cross-border activities, we find evidence that banks without a local affiliate presence abroad cut back their non-bank lending to countries applying restrictions, and vice versa when restrictions are liberalised. On the other hand, banks with a local presence reduce their intragroup loans, but substitute for this by increasing direct cross-border lending to non-banks. These findings suggest that increasing services trade restrictiveness may lead global banks to reshape their business model for cross-border lending. Services trade restrictions that act on the intensive margin of lending, such as barriers to competition, appear to be the primary drivers of this substitution from \u2018local\u2019 to \u2018global\u2019 financial intermediation."],"Author":"Simon Lloyd, Dennis Reinhardt and Rhiannon Sowerbutts","Number":1022},{"Title":"Self-fulfilling fire sales and market backstops","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/self-fulfilling-fire-sales-and-market-backstops","Date":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["Motivated by the March 2020 \u2018dash for cash\u2019, we build a model in which a potential liquidity shock to bond funds can prompt a self-fulfilling fire sale in the presence of a dealer with limited trading capacity.\u00a0Following the global games literature, we derive the probability of a self-fulfilling fire sale. Introducing a central bank market backstop policy, we show that if the central bank can credibly commit to (i) set the size of its potential asset purchases high enough and (ii) its price discount low enough, then it can eliminate self-fulfilling fire sales without having to purchase any bonds. If the central bank acts less aggressively, it can still reduce the probability of a self-fulfilling fire sale. However, in response to the policy, funds choose to hold more bonds, which increases the probability of a self-fulfilling fire sale and reduces the effectiveness of the market backstop."],"Author":"Harkeerit Kalsi,\u00a0Nicholas Vause\u00a0and Nora Wegner","Number":1020},{"Title":"The gravity of syndication ties in international equity underwriting","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/the-gravity-of-syndication-ties-in-international-equity-underwriting","Date":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["We examine how cross-border syndication ties reduce information frictions and positively impact exports of equity underwriting services.

We provide a detailed account of how selling pressure in gilt markets \u2013 due to deteriorating derivative and repo positions of liability-driven investors (LDI) \u2013 led to evaporating market liquidity, especially in long-dated conventional gilts and index-linked gilts. We find that firms in the LDI-pension-insurance (LDI-PI) sector who had larger repo and swap exposure before the crisis sold more gilts during the crisis (while hedge funds were compensated for providing liquidity to the LDI-PI sector). Transaction costs in bond markets quickly soared, particularly for smaller trades, for trades at smaller dealers and for trades of non-LDI-PI investors too. The aggregate dispersion of transaction prices more than doubled in a matter of days, and price dispersion across primary dealers remained significant throughout the crisis, suggestive of tightened constraints on the intermediary sector. While the episode started with the forced selling by the LDI-PI sector, our results point to large costs on other market segments as well, consistent with the contagious nature of illiquidity."],"Author":"Gabor Pinter","Number":1019},{"Title":"Revisiting the effects of long-term unemployment on inflation: the role of non-linearities","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/revisiting-the-effects-of-long-term-unemployment-on-inflation","Date":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Abstract":["We demonstrate that it is necessary to control for state dependence in the Phillips curve in order to be able to appropriately identify separate slopes for short and long-term unemployment rates. Whereas several existing studies have typically concluded that long-term unemployment is largely immaterial for price pressures, our evidence suggests that the effect of long-term unemployment on inflation is highly state dependent. In particular, reductions in long-term unemployment are found to be significantly inflationary when aggregate unemployment is low, displaying a larger and more immediate peak effect on inflation than short-term unemployment. The explanation for our finding is a direct consequence of allowing for non-linearity in the Phillips curve together with short and long-term unemployment gaps that enter the specification separately. Variation in long-term unemployment typically arises following large recessionary shocks and the Phillips curve also tends to be flatter in deep recessions. It therefore follows that the comovement between long-term unemployment and inflation will be understated in linear regressions. In order to address this, we adopt a flexible methodology that combines non-linearity and heterogeneity in the unemployment duration distribution, enabling us to control for this confounding effect of state dependence on the identification of separate Phillips-curve slopes for short and long-term unemployment. Our results would caution against underweighting long-term unemployment in the inflation-relevant measure of economic slack, especially when unemployment is low."],"Author":"Vania Esady, Bradley Speigner and Boromeus Wanengkirtyo","Number":1018},{"Title":"Understanding climate-related disclosures of UK financial institutions","Link":"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/working-paper\/2023\/understanding-climate-related-disclosures-of-uk-financial-institutions","Date":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 14:00:00 Z","Abstract":["Climate-related disclosures reduce information asymmetries between firms and investors and help transition to a net-zero economy.

Moreover, interest rate derivatives usage is highly concentrated among a few investors, which could increase the aggregate consequences of idiosyncratic shocks to these investors.

This cross-sector netting reduces the aggregate net demand that is supplied by dealers. However, two factors impede cross-sector netting and add to dealer imbalances across maturities. (i) PF&I, bank and corporate demand is segmented across maturities. (ii) Large volumes are traded by hedge funds, who behave like banks in the short-end and like PF&I in the long-end. This worsens segmentation, exposing dealers to a steepening or flattening of the yield curve in addition to residual duration risk.
