[{"Title":"Learning Monetary Policy Strategies at the Effective Lower Bound with Sudden Surprises","Author":"Spencer\u00a0Krane, Leonardo\u00a0Melosi, Matthias\u00a0Rottner","Abstract":"Central banks around the world have revised their operating frameworks in an attempt to counter the challenges presented by the effective lower bound (ELB) on policy rates. We examine how private sector agents might learn such a new regime and the effect of future shocks on that process. In our model agents use Bayesian updating to learn the parameters of an asymmetric average inflation targeting rule that is adopted while at the ELB. Little can be discovered until the economy improves enough that rates would be near liftoff under the old policy regime; learning then proceeds until either the new parameters are learned or the average inflation target is reached. Recessionary shocks forcing a return to the ELB would thus delay learning while large inflationary shocks could outright stop it and so inhibit the ability of the new rule to address future ELB episodes. We show the central bank can offset some of the inflation-induced learning loss by deviating from its new rule, but it must weigh the benefits of doing so against the costs of higher near-term inflation and greater uncertainty about the policy function.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-22","Number":"2023-22","Date":1685577600000,"_merge":"right_only"},{"Title":"Women\u2019s Colleges and Economics Major Choice: Evidence from Wellesley College Applicants","Author":"Kristin\u00a0Butcher, Patrick J.\u00a0McEwan, Akila \u00a0Weerapana","Abstract":"Many observers argue that diversity in Economics and STEM fields is critical, not simply because of egalitarian goals, but because who is in a field may shape what is studied by it.  If increasing the rate of majoring in mathematically-intensive fields among women is a worthy goal, then understanding whether women\u2019s colleges causally affect that choice is important. Among all admitted applicants to Wellesley College, enrollees are 7.2 percentage points (94%) more likely to receive an Economics degree than non-enrollees (a plausible lower bound given negative selection into enrollment on math skills and major preferences). Overall, 3.2 percentage points\u2014or 44% of the difference between enrollees and non-enrollees\u2014is explained by college exposure to female instructors and students, consistent with a wider role for women\u2019s colleges in increasing female participation in Economics.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-21","Number":"2023-21","Date":1685577600000,"_merge":"right_only"}]
