[{"Title":"What Does the CDS Market Imply for a U.S. Default?","Author":"Luca\u00a0Benzoni, Christian\u00a0Cabanilla, Alessandro\u00a0Cocco, Cullen\u00a0Kavoussi","Abstract":"(Revised May 2023)\nAs the debt ceiling episode unfolds, we highlight a sharp increase in trading activity and liquidity in the U.S. credit default swaps (CDS) market, as well as a spike in U.S. CDS premiums. Compared with the periods leading up to the 2011 and 2013 debt ceiling episodes, we show that elevated CDS spreads in the current environment are partially explained by the cheapening of deliverable Treasury collateral to CDS contracts. We infer the likelihood of a U.S. default from these CDS premiums, and estimate an increase in the market-implied default probability from about 0.3\u20130.4% in 2022, to around 4% in April 2023, which is lower than it was in July 2011 and about where it was in October 2013. Finally, we document changes in Treasury bills trading activity as market participant update their expectations for a U.S. default.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-17","Number":"2023-17","Date":1680307200000,"_merge":"right_only"},{"Title":"International Diversification, Reallocation, and the Labor Share","Author":"Joel\u00a0David, Romain\u00a0Ranciere, David\u00a0Zeke","Abstract":"How does growing international financial diversification affect firm-level and aggregate labor shares? We study this question using a novel framework of firm labor choice in the face of aggregate risk. The theory implies a cross-section of labor risk premia and labor shares that appear as markups in firm-level data. International risk sharing leads to a reallocation of labor towards riskier\/low labor share firms alongside a rise in within-firm labor shares, matching key micro-level facts. We use cross-country firm-level data to document a number of empirical patterns consistent with the theory, namely: (i) riskier firms have lower labor shares and (ii) international financial diversification is associated with a reallocation towards risky\/low labor share firms. Our estimates suggest the reallocation effect has dominated the within effect in recent decades; on net, increased financial integration has reduced the corporate labor share in the U.S. by about 2.5 percentage points, roughly one-third of the total decline since the 1970s.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-16","Number":"2023-16","Date":1680307200000,"_merge":"right_only"},{"Title":"Bank Branch Access: Evidence from Geolocation Data","Author":"Jung\u00a0Sakong, Alexander K.\u00a0Zentefis","Abstract":"Low-income and Black households are less likely to visit bank branches than high-income and White households, despite the former two groups appearing to rely more on branches as means of bank participation. We assess whether unequal branch access can explain that disparity. We propose a measure of bank branch access based on a gravity model of consumer trips to bank branches, estimated using mobile device geolocation data. Residents have better branch access if branches are closer or have superior qualities that attract more visitors. Because the geolocation data is distorted to protect user privacy, we estimate the gravity model with a new econometric method that adapts the Method of Simulated Moments to handle high-dimensional fixed effects. We find no evidence that low-income communities lack access to bank branches and instead find that lower demand for bank branch products or services explains their lower branch use. But in Black communities, worse access explains their entire drop-off in branch use. For residents of these areas, weaker access is not from having lower quality branches, but from branches being located farther away from them. The results highlight parts of the country that would benefit the most from policies that expand access to banking.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-15","Number":"2023-15","Date":1680307200000,"_merge":"right_only"},{"Title":"Who Cares? Paid Sick Leave Mandates, Care-Giving, and Gender","Author":"Tanya\u00a0Byker, Elena\u00a0Patel, Shanthi\u00a0Ramnath","Abstract":"We use employment data from the Current Population Survey to assess the efficacy of state-mandated paid sick leave policies on leave-taking behavior with a focus on any variation by gender. We find that these policies increase leave taking for care-giving for men by 10-20%, and this effect is strongest for men with young children in the household. In addition, we find that Hispanic men and men without a bachelor\u2019s degree, who historically have had low access to paid sick leave, are 20\u201325% more likely to take care-giving leave. By comparison, we do not find evidence that these policies affect leave taking for own sickness for men or women, nor do we find evidence that these policies affect care-giving leave taking for women. Our evidence highlights the importance of studying care-giving leave within the context of paid leave policies and the importance of considering gender differences in the treatment effect within this context.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-14","Number":"2023-14","Date":1680307200000,"_merge":"right_only"},{"Title":"The Effects of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs on Labor Market Activity and Credit Outcomes","Author":"Sumedha\u00a0Gupta, Bhash\u00a0Mazumder","Abstract":"We examine how the availability of prescription opioids affects labor market activity and household economic well-being. While greater access to opioids may lead people to substance use disorders and negative economic consequences, appropriate pain medication may allow some individuals to effectively participate in the labor market. We study prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), which were designed to curb inappropriate opioid prescribing and assess how these policies affected labor force attachment and credit outcomes. We use variation across states in the timing of implementation of PDMPs and recent methods developed for difference-in-difference event study designs with multiple time periods. In line with previous work, we find that PDMPs lead to a decline in opioid prescribing rates. Although we find that these reductions in opioid supply have no clear effect on measures of labor force activity in our pooled sample, we see some suggestive evidence of negative effects on labor force attachment in states where there is less scope for substitution to illicit drugs. We also show that PDMPs lead to a decline in credit scores and increases in the number and amount of third-party debt collections, and that these effects are more pronounced in states lacking an illicit market. These findings suggest that some individuals are likely negatively affected by the lack of access to pain medication due to the PDMP laws.","Link":"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2023\/2023-13","Number":"2023-13","Date":1677628800000,"_merge":"right_only"}]
