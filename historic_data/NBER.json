Using firm-level balance-sheet data along with data on the domestic production network, we first assess the policy\u2019s direct and indirect impacts. We find an increase in economic activity in industry-province pairs that were the focus of the subsidy program, and positive spillovers to the suppliers and customers of subsidized firms. With the aid of a dynamic multi-region, multi-industry general equilibrium model, we then assess the program\u2019s impacts. Based on the calibrated model we find that, in the long run, the subsidy program is modestly successful in reducing inequality between the relatively under-developed and more prosperous portions of the country. These modest longer-term effects are due to the ability of households to migrate in response to the subsidy program and to input-output linkages that traverse subsidy regions within Turkey.","Author":["Enghin Atalay","Ali Horta\u00e7su","Mustafa Runyun","Chad Syverson","Mehmet Fatih Ulu"],"Number":31293},{"Title":"Exchange Controls As A Fiscal Instrument","Link":"https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w31294","Date":1685577600000,"Abstract":"About 20 percent of countries have in place dual, multiple, or parallel exchange rates.

We calibrate the model to Argentina, which over the past decade has experienced significant exchange controls and persistent fiscal deficits. We show that exchange controls can generate sizable fiscal revenue. However, the optimal level of exchange controls is virtually zero. Financing the fiscal deficit with exchange controls is possible but entails large welfare losses.","Author":["Stephanie Schmitt-Groh\u00e9","Mart\u00edn Uribe"],"Number":31294},{"Title":"The Debt-Inflation Channel of the German Hyperinflation","Link":"https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w31298","Date":1685577600000,"Abstract":"This paper studies how a large increase in the price level is transmitted to the real economy through firm balance sheets.

Firms with higher nominal liabilities at the onset of inflation experienced a larger decline in interest expenses, a relative increase in their equity values, and higher employment during the inflation. The results are consistent with real effects of a debt-inflation channel that operates even when prices and wages are flexible.","Author":["Markus K. Brunnermeier","Sergio A.

If countries follow monetary policies of flexible inflation targeting, trade wars are relatively mild, with low equilibrium tariffs and small welfare costs. Discretionary monetary policies imply much higher tariffs, high inflation rates, and substantially larger welfare costs. We quantify the effects of a global trade war among major economies using estimates of trade elasticities, economic size, net foreign assets and trade openness.

We distinguish two types of policy spillovers associated with diverse policy approaches to climate change. First, when countries have different levels of climate ambition, free-riders will benefit at the expense of more committed countries. Second, when countries pursue different approaches, carbon-intensive producers within cost-imposing jurisdictions will be at a relative competitive disadvantage compared with producers in subsidizing jurisdictions. Carbon border adjustments and climate clubs are attempts to respond to these policy spillovers, but when countries have divergent policy approaches, one policy alone will not be able to address both types of spillovers. We also consider the policy dynamics that result from carbon border adjustments and climate clubs; both have the potential to encourage upward harmonization of climate policy, but they come with risks. Further, the pressures of international competition in the presence of divergent climate policy approaches may result in subsidy races, which come with their own potential risks and benefits.","Author":["Kimberly A.

We show how features of the distribution of marginal products can be identified from exogenous variation in firms' input use, and how these features can be used both to test for misallocation and to quantify the welfare losses that it causes.  We then consider an application in which thousands of firms experience demand shocks derived from a lottery-based assignment of public procurement contracts for construction services in Ecuador. Using administrative tax data about these firms, we reject the null of efficiency but estimate that the welfare losses resulting from misallocation are only 1.6% relative to the first-best.

Local governments in Upstate NY realize more business taxes, but this only offsets a small portion of the costs from higher community electricity bills.

These migrants laid the groundwork for Confederate symbols and racial norms to become pervasive nationally in the early 20th century. Occupying positions of authority, former slaveholders played an outsized role in this process. Beyond memorializing the Confederacy, migrants exacerbated racial violence, boosted novel forms of exclusion, and compounded Black disadvantage outside the South. Moving West, former Confederates had larger effects in frontier communities lacking established culture and institutions. Over time, they continued to transmit norms to their children and non-Southern neighbors. The diaspora legacy persists over the long run, shaping racial inequities in labor, housing, and policing. Together, our findings offer a new perspective on migration, elite influence, and the interplay between culture and institutions in the nation-building process.","Author":["Samuel Bazzi","Andreas Ferrara","Martin Fiszbein","Thomas P.

Highly recommended supervisors experienced no productivity gains; in contrast, less-recommended supervisors' productivity increased 12% relative to controls.

We employ a parameterized difference-in-differences method and use national data from a sample of parents who are receiving, or recently received, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (N~20,500).

This paper provides a theoretical and quantitative analysis of this new tool. We build a tractable equilibrium model in which the financially constrained exporter of a non-renewable resource optimally exerts market power, and the price of the resource varies stochastically. An important insight from this framework is that the supply curve is inelastic and can even be downward sloping, rationalizing the patterns we observe in the data. Contrary to the fears that an introduction of the price cap will cause a damaging oil supply shock, the exporter may have strong incentives to increase extraction following the introduction of a binding price cap. In fact, when the producer is large and has market power, a price cap that applies to all or most sales significantly limits the degree to which market power is used in equilibrium and stabilizes world oil prices. But if the cap is poorly enforced, or if the sanctioned state has access to a non-compliant \u201cshadow\u201d fleet, the cap is less effective at stabilizing world prices.","Author":["Simon Johnson","Lukasz Rachel","Catherine Wolfram"],"Number":31347},{"Title":"War Discourse and the Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns","Link":"https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w31348","Date":1685577600000,"Abstract":"A war-related factor model derived from textual analysis of media news reports explains the cross section of expected asset returns.

To improve the realism of policy evaluation, it is desirable to enrich understanding of behavior and develop methods of analysis that use the enriched understanding to assess policies. Attention has been given to recognition that behavior may be boundedly rational, but little has been done to draw the implications of this work for mechanism design. Behavioral economists have suggested that planners should limit the choices available to individuals or should frame the options in a manner thought to influence choice, but the discussion has commonly been verbal and casual. We formally consider a planner who has the power to design a discrete choice set from which individuals will choose. We suppose that individuals may be boundedly rational and, hence, may not maximize utility. Our concern is realistic settings in which persons have heterogeneous preferences and may vary in how their choices deviate from utility maximization. We find that optimal paternalism is subtle. The policy that most effectively constrains or influences individual choices depends on the distribution of preferences and the choice probabilities measuring the extent to which persons behave suboptimally, conditional on their preferences.","Author":["Charles F.
