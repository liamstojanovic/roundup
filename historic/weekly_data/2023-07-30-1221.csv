0,Unobserved components model(s): output gaps and financial cycles,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2832~51322fbd6a.en.pdf,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200","The Global Financial Crisis established that policymakers should consider the stage of the financial cycle to better evaluate the cyclical position of the economy when designing monetary policy decisions. If financial variables are omitted from the estimations of the output gap, a common and unobserved indicator of the business cycle, important financial or external imbalances that may lead to future recessions may not be captured. This paper presents a suite of estimates of output gaps incorporating financial variables. The estimates are based both on small unobserved components models and a large unobserved components model that follows a production function approach. The results show that exploiting the information content of financial variables, which co-move strongly with the output cycle, can sometimes improve output gap estimates. However, these improvements are of a limited magnitude and very sensitive to the choice of the chosen financial variables.","Justine Guillochon, Julien Le Roux",2832
1,New technologies and jobs in Europe,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2831~fabeeb6849.en.pdf,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200","We examine the link between labour market developments and new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and software in 16 European countries over the period 2011-2019. Using data for occupations at the 3-digit level in Europe, we find that on average employment shares have increased in occupations more exposed to AI. This is particularly the case for occupations with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers. This evidence is in line with the Skill Biased Technological Change theory. While there exists heterogeneity across countries, only very few countries show a decline in employment shares of occupations more exposed to AI-enabled automation. Country heterogeneity for this result seems to be linked to the pace of technology diffusion and education, but also to the level of product market regulation (competition) and employment protection laws. In contrast to the findings for employment, we find little evidence for a relationship between wages and potential exposures to new technologies.","Stefania Albanesi , António Dias da Silva , Juan F.

2,Density forecasts of inflation: a quantile regression forest approach,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2830~81049ee58f.en.pdf,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200","Density forecasts of euro area inflation are a fundamental input for a medium-term oriented central bank, such as the European Central Bank (ECB). We show that a quantile regression forest, capturing a general non-linear relationship between euro area (headline and core) inflation and a large set of determinants, is competitive with state-of-the-art linear benchmarks and judgemental survey forecasts. The median forecasts of the quantile regression forest are very collinear with the ECB point inflation forecasts, displaying similar deviations from “linearity”. Given that the ECB modelling toolbox is overwhelmingly linear, this finding suggests that the expert judgement embedded in the ECB forecast may be characterized by some mild non-linearity.","Density forecasts of inﬂation: a quantile regression forest approach Michele Lenza , Inès Moutachaker , Joan Paredes",2830
3,Life insurance convexity,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2829~f36cabd504.en.pdf,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200","Life insurers sell savings contracts with surrender options, which allow policyholders to prematurely receive guaranteed surrender values. These surrender options move toward the money when interest rates rise. Hence, higher interest rates raise surrender rates, as we document empirically by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in monetary policy. Using a calibrated model, we then estimate that surrender options would force insurers to sell up to 2% of their investments during an enduring interest rate rise of 25 bps per year. We show that these fire sales are fueled by surrender value guarantees and insurers’ long-term investments.","Nicolaus Grochola , Helmut Gr ündl, Christian Kubitza",2829
4,The state-dependent impact of changes in bank capital requirements,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2828~9c4e7428de.en.pdf,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200","Based on a non-linear equilibrium model of the banking sector with an occasionally-binding equity issuance constraint, we show that the economic impact of changes in bank capital requirements depends on the state of the macro-financial environment. In ”normal” states where banks do not face problems to retain enough profits to satisfy higher capital requirements, the impact on bank loan supply works through a ”pricing channel” which is small: around 0.1% less loans for a 1pp increase in capital requirements. In ”bad” states where banks are not able to come up with sufficient equity to satisfy capital requirements, the impact on loan supply works through a ”quantity channel”, which acts like a financial accelerator and can be very large: up to 10% more loans for a capital requirement release of 1pp. Compared to existing DSGE models with a banking sector, which usually feature a constant lending response of around 1%, our state-dependent impact is an order of magnitude lower in ”normal” states and an order of magnitude higher in ”bad” states. Our results provide a theoretical justification for building up a positive countercyclical capital buffer in ”normal” macro-financial environments.","The state -dependent impact of changes in bank capital requirements Jan Hannes Lang , Dominik Menno",2828
5,Rational inattention and the business cycle effects of productivity and news shocks,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2827~0b39cb6d81.en.pdf,"Tue, 04 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200","We solve a real business cycle model with rational inattention (an RI-RBC model). In the RIRBC model, the growth rates of employment, investment, and output are about as persistent as in the data, with an amount of inattention consistent with survey data on expectations. Moreover, consumption, employment, and output move in the same direction in response to news about future productivity. By contrast, the baseline RBC model produces neither persistent growth rates nor business cycle comovement after news shocks.","Bartosz Ma ćkowiak , Mirko Wiederholt",2827

We look at the number of banking relationships, reliance on the main bank, credit instruments, loan maturity, and interest rates. Firms in Southern Europe borrow from more banks and obtain a lower share of credit from the main bank than those in Northern Europe. They also tend to borrow more on short term, more expensive instru-ments and to obtain loans with shorter maturity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that firms in Southern Europe rely less on relationship banking and obtain credit less conducive to firm growth, in line with their smaller average size. Relationship lending does not translate in lower rates, possibly because banks appropriate part of the surplus generated by relationship lending through higher rates.","Firm-bank relationships: a cross -country comparison Kamelia Kosekova , Angela Maddaloni , Melina Papoutsi , Fabiano Schivardi",2826

First, we ﬁnd that liquidity buﬀers reduced outﬂows during March 2020 only to a limited extent. Second, we ﬁnd that funds entering the crisis with higher liquidity buﬀers were less likely to involve in cash hoarding and more likely to use cash buﬀers to meet outﬂows. Our results suggest that higher liquidity buﬀers can reduce procyclicality primarily through supporting the liquidity management strategies employed by fund managers.","Liquidity buﬀers and open -end investment funds: containing outﬂows and reducing ﬁre sales Lennart Dekker , Luis Molestina Vivar , Michael Wedow , Christian Weistroﬀer",2825
8,Central bank communication and trust: an experimental study on the European Central Bank and the general public,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2824~446692e8f3.en.pdf,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 11:00:00 +0200","While it has become clear that communication is a monetary policy tool for central banks, and extensive research has been conducted on central bank communication with financial markets, little is known so far on central bank communication with the general public. My research provides new insights into this field, confirming that the efforts of central banks to connect with a wider public are not in vain. In a randomised controlled trial, I focus on the determinants of trust in the European Central Bank (ECB) and on understanding of its communication about the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, which was set up as part of the ECB’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. I find that the ECB’s simplified and relatable communication leads to greater trust in the central bank among the general public, as it has a positive impact on perceptions of the ECB among laypeople. The simplified content also proves to contribute to increased understanding of the central bank’s messages among the wider public.",Sarah Mochhoury,2824
9,"Asset prices, collateral and bank lending: the case of Covid-19 and real estate",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2823~0a128abbd2.en.pdf,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 11:00:00 +0200",Our paper uses credit registry data for the euro area to examine how the banking system transmits asset price shocks to credit via revaluation of collateral and subsequent lending decisions. Specifically we examine banks’ treatment of real estate collateral during the Covid-19 crisis. First we find evidence of significant frictions in the trans-mission of asset price dynamics to collateral values. Despite this we find that lending relationships reliant on real estate collateral received one third less credit following the outbreak of the pandemic and that firms experiencing downward revaluations of their collateral were significantly less likely to be given new loans. Our findings confirm that the collateral channel does create an economically significant link between real estate values and credit but suggest that the banking system’s role in transmission may be more complex than traditional economic theory would imply.,"Asset prices, collateral and bank lending : the case of Covid -19 and real estate Aoife Horan , Barbara Jarmulska , Ellen Ryan",2823
10,Are preferential agreements beneficial to EU trade? New evidence from the EU-South Korea treaty,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2822~d0ad211f0b.en.pdf,"Wed, 24 May 2023 11:00:00 +0200","This paper empirically investigates the effect of the EU-South Korea free trade agreement (FTA) on manufacturing trade flows. By applying a state-of-the-art structural gravity model with intranational (i.e., domestic) trade and using disaggregated data, we quantify both the trade impact and the observed heterogeneity in the FTA estimates. In line with literature, we find that the FTA exerted asymmetric effects in bilateral exports across directions of trade. Compared to previous studies, our findings suggest a different explanation for the poor performances of Korean exports to the EU in the post-FTA period, namely offshoring patterns in electronics and a broad-based decline in the shipbuilding industry. When we drop these two export categories from the analysis, we show that the FTA exerted a large effect on trade in both directions, increasing bilateral exports by about 30 percent. We then investigate heterogeneity in pair-industry-specific estimates of the FTA. The main source of variation is represented by asymmetries in ex ante trade barriers across sectors, with a prominent role for non-tariff instruments. Stronger pre-FTA regulatory intensity is associated to a high liberalization potential, favouring larger FTA estimates.","Beniamino Quintieri, Giovanni Stamato",2822
11,"The impact of global warming on inflation: averages, seasonality and extremes",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2821~f008e5cb9c.en.pdf,"Tue, 23 May 2023 11:00:00 +0200","Understanding of the macroeconomic effects of climate change is developing rapidly, but the implications for past and future inflation remain less well understood. Here we exploit a global dataset of monthly consumer price indices to identify the causal impacts of changes in climate on inflation, and to assess their implications under future warming. Flexibly accounting for heterogenous impacts across seasons and baseline climatic and socio-economic conditions, we find that increased average temperatures cause non-linear upwards inflationary pressures which persist over 12 months in both higher- and lower-income countries. Projections from state-of-the-art climate models show that in the absence of historically un-precedented adaptation, future warming will cause global increases in annual food and headline inflation of 0.92-3.23 and 0.32-1.18 percentage-points per year respectively, under 2035 projected climate (uncertainty range across emission scenarios, climate models and empirical specifications), as well as altering the seasonal dynamics of inflation. Moreover, we estimate that the 2022 summer heat extreme increased food inflation in Europe by 0.67 (0.43-0.93) percentage-points and that future warming projected for 2035 would amplify the impacts of such extremes by 50%. These results suggest that climate change poses risks to price stability by having an upward impact on inflation, altering its seasonality and amplifying the impacts caused by extremes.","Maximilian Kotz, Friderike Kuik, Eliza Lis, Christiane Nickel",2821
12,Environmental regulation and productivity growth in the euro area: testing the Porter hypothesis,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2820~40f84bea89.en.pdf,"Tue, 23 May 2023 11:00:00 +0200","This paper analyses the impact of changes in environmental regulations on productivity growth at country- and firm-level. We exploit several data sources and the environmen-tal policy stringency index, to evaluate the Porter hypothesis, according to which firms’ productivity can benefit from more stringent environmental policies. By using panel local projections, we estimate the regulatory impact over a five-year horizon. The identification of causal impacts of regulatory changes is achieved by the estimation of firms’ CO2 emissions via a machine learning algorithm. At country- and firm-level, policy tightening affects high-polluters’ productivity negatively and stronger than their less-polluting peers. However, among high-polluting firms, large ones experience positive total factor productivity growth due to easier access to finance and greater innovativeness. Hence, we do not find support for the Porter hypothesis in general. However for technology support policies and firms with the required resources, policy tightening can enhance productivity.","Nicola Benatti , Martin Groiss , Petra Kelly , Paloma Lopez -Garcia",2820
13,Macroeconomic effects of carbon transition policies: an assessment based on the ECB’s New Area-Wide Model with a disaggregated energy sector,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2819~757438ecbe.en.pdf,"Wed, 17 May 2023 11:00:00 +0200","We use scenario analysis to assess the macroeconomic eﬀects of carbon transition policies aimed at mitigating climate change. To this end, we employ a version of the ECB’s New Area-Wide Model (NAWM) augmented with a framework of disaggregated energy production and use, which distinguishes between “dirty” and “clean” energy. Our central transition scenario is that of a permanent increase in carbon taxes, which are levied as a surcharge on the price of dirty energy. Our ﬁndings suggest that increasing euro area carbon taxes to an interim target level consistent with the transition to a net-zero economy entails a transitory rise in inﬂation and a lasting, albeit moderate decline in GDP. We show that the short and medium-term eﬀects depend on the monetary policy reaction, on the path of the carbon tax increase and on its credibility, while expanding clean energy supply is key for containing the decline in GDP. Undesirable distributional eﬀects can be addressed by redistributing the ﬁscal revenues from the carbon tax increase to low-income households.","Günter Coenen, Matija Lozej , Romanos Priftis",2819

To answer this question we merge CDS trades reported under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) with syndicated loans from DealScan, and compare the prices on similar CDSs that the same dealer oﬀers to banks and to other investors. We ﬁnd that banks lending to a corporation purchase CDSs on this corporation at lower prices, and that, after trading with banks, dealers can earn higher margins on these CDSs when trading with other investors. Our ﬁndings suggest that banks hold valuable private information which is shared in their trades with dealers. Dealers then disseminate this information to ﬁnancial markets.","Andrada Bilan , Steven Ongena , Cosimo Pancaro",2818

This comment shows that a central bank that wants to dampen bubbles can always do so by raising interest rates aggressively enough. This result is different from the Miao, Shen and Wang (2019) comment on Galí’s paper. They argue Galí’s model contains additional equilibria in which more aggressive rules dampen bubbles. We show that for these equilibria, more aggressive rules involve threats to raise interest rates more than actual rate increases.","Franklin Allen, Gadi Barlevy, Douglas Gale",2023-25

A significant shortcoming of nowcasting estimators is their “reduced-form” nature, which means they cannot be used to assess the impact of policy changes, for example, on the baseline nowcast of real GDP. This paper outlines two separate methodologies to address this problem. The first is a partial equilibrium approach that uses an existing baseline nowcasting regression and single-equation 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�(𝑝�𝑝�,𝑞�𝑞�) forecasting models for the high-frequency data in that regression. The second approach uses a non-parametric structural VAR estimator recently introduced in Ouliaris and Pagan (2022) that imposes minimal identifying restrictions on the data to estimate the impact of structural shocks.

COVID-19 was the latest such episode. To escape this negative drift, and build a durable recovery, there is a need for acounter-balancing force: to construct a positive shock. Growth is realized through decisions that fall under two categories, routine and non-linear. While routine decisions modify existing economic behavior along the same path, non-linear decisions describe riskier options that involve transformation. Option pricing theory can be useful to describe the latter, and construct the positive shock required to escape the negative drift.",['Mehmet Cangul'],WPIEA2023152
NBER31403,Bridging the Gap: Mismatch Effects and Catch-Up Dynamics in a Brazilian College Affirmative Action,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31403,July 2023,"Affirmative action in higher education can lead to mismatch, where students admitted through preferential treatment struggle academically due to inadequate preparation before college. Although some students may face initial challenges, by providing access to quality education for talented individuals who might have otherwise been overlooked due to systemic disadvantages, these programs may enable students to bridge the gap and catch up to their peers. In this study, we examine the effects of a quota-type affirmative action policy on gaps in college outcomes between potential beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Using comprehensive administrative data from a leading Brazilian university which implemented affirmative action in 2005, we find that compared to their non-quota peers, potential quota beneficiaries are less likely to progress smoothly through college and less likely to graduate, a result that is mostly driven by those who would not be admitted to the university otherwise. Notably, however, most of these differences shrink as the students progress through college, suggesting a catch-up effect between those groups. While potential quota students initially face challenges, resulting in a reduced course load in their early college years, they compensate by taking more credits in later years to ultimately graduate.","['Rodrigo Oliveira', 'Alei Santos', 'Edson R.
