BIS1096,Money market funds and the pricing of near-money assets,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1096.htm,2023-05-02T12:00:00Z,"US money market funds (MMFs) play an important role in short-term markets as large investors of Treasury bills (T-bills) and repurchase agreements (repos). We build a theoretical model in which MMFs strategically interact with banks and each other. These interactions generate interdependencies between repo and T-bill markets, affecting the pricing of these near-money assets."," Sebastian Doerr, Egemen Eren and Semyon Malamud",1096
BIS1089,Intraday liquidity around the world,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.htm,2023-04-14T13:00:00Z,"We study intraday liquidity usage and its determinants using a unique cross-country data set on large-value payments. We document that the amount of intraday liquidity that financial institutions around the world use each day equals, on average, 15% of their total daily payment values or 2.8% of their countries' GDP."," Biliana Alexandrova Kabadjova, Anton Badev, Saulo Benchimol Bastos, Evangelos Benos, Freddy Cepeda- Lopéz, James Chapman, Martin Diehl, Ioana Duca-Radu, Rodney Garratt, Ronald Heijmans, Anneke Kosse, Antoine Martin, Thomas Nellen, Thomas Nilsson, Jan Paulick, Andrei Pustelnikov, Francisco Rivadeneyra, Mario Rubem do Coutto Bastos and Sara Testi",1089
NBER31401,Policy Uncertainty Reduces Green Investment,https://www.nber.org/papers/w31401,July 2023,"Government subsidies are often used to stimulate environment-friendly investment. We find that Chinese firms reduce green investment as the uncertainty of subsidies rises. This effect is identified from weather-driven fluctuations in air pollution that lead to fluctuations in subsidy allocations: Firms in cities where weather-driven subsidy uncertainty is high engage in less green R&D investment, patent applications, and research staff. Industries that are heavy emitters and those focused on environmental technologies are more affected. The results suggest that policy uncertainty may originate not only from political and macroeconomic shocks but from behavioral mechanisms that link policy to salient recent conditions.","['Mengyu Wang', 'Jeffrey Wurgler', 'Hong Zhang']",31401
BIS1088,Big techs and the credit channel of monetary policy,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1088.htm,2023-04-06T09:00:00Z,We view big tech credit through the lens of a model where big techs facilitate matching on their e-commerce platforms and extend loans. The big tech enforces credit repayment discipline with the threat of exclusion from the platform.," Fiorella De Fiore, Leonardo Gambacorta and Cristina Manea",1088
BIS1101,Insights into credit loss rates: a global database,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1101.htm,2023-05-26T09:00:00Z,"Credit risk was a key factor in the Great Financial Crisis and numerous other crises. Banks' overall credit losses tend to increase suddenly during a crisis from the typically low levels seen during ""normal"" times. ..."," Li Lian Ong, Christian Schmieder and Min Wei",1101
BIS1112,Trust bridges and money flows,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1112.htm,2023-07-25T12:00:00Z,"Cross-border payments are expensive, slow, and opaque. These problems reflect multiple frictions, many of which boil down to limited trust among counterparties. Trust plays a central role in exchanging credit-based money. End users need to trust the issuers of money, and issuers must trust users to satisfy financial integrity requirements."," Tobias Adrian, Rodney Garratt, Dong He and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli",1112
BIS1091,"FinTech, investor sophistication and financial portfolio choices",http://www.bis.org/publ/work1091.htm,2023-04-21T12:00:00Z,"This paper analyses the links between advances in financial technology, investors' sophistication, and the composition and returns of their financial portfolios. We develop a simple portfolio choice model under asymmetric information and derive some theoretical predictions."," Leonardo Gambacorta, Romina Gambacorta and Roxana Mihet",1091
BIS1102,MPC heterogeneity and the dynamic response of consumption to monetary policy,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1102.htm,2023-05-30T09:00:00Z,"This paper studies how household financial choices affect the impact of monetary policy on consumption. Based on micro data from four major euro area countries, we estimate structural parameters to match moments related to asset market participation rates, portfolio shares and wealth-to-income ratios by education and country. The country specific distributions of the marginal propensity to consume out of income and financial wealth are not degenerate, reflecting, among other factors, costs to both asset market participation and portfolio adjustment."," Miguel Ampudia, Russell Cooper, Julia Le Blanc and Guozhong Zhu",1102

It shows that patenting rates tend to converge over time (patenting growth is faster when initial patents are lower), including within countries (across industries) and within industries (across countries)...", Bryan Hardy and Can Sever,1108
BIS1105,The demand for government debt,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1105.htm,2023-06-08T12:00:00Z,"We document that the sectoral composition and marginal buyers of government debt differ notably across jurisdictions and have evolved significantly over time. Focusing on the United States, we estimate the yield elasticity of demand across sectors using instrumental variables constructed from monetary policy surprises."," Egemen Eren, Andreas Schrimpf and Dora Xia",1105
BIS1093,Sovereign risk and bank lending: evidence from 1999 Turkish earthquake,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1093.htm,2023-04-26T12:00:00Z,"We use an exogenous fiscal shock to identify the transmission of government risk to bank lending due to banks holding government bonds. We illustrate with a theoretical model that for banks with higher exposure to government bonds, a higher sovereign default risk implies lower bank net worth and less lending."," Yusuf Soner Başkaya, Bryan Hardy, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan and Vivian Yue",1093

BIS1094,The foreign exchange market,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1094.htm,2023-04-27T12:00:00Z,"This chapter discusses the structure and functioning of the spot foreign exchange (FX) market. The market structure, which has become far more complex over the past three decades, has mostly evolved endogenously as the global FX market is subject to notably less regulatory oversight than equity and bond markets in most countries."," Alain Chaboud, Dagfinn Rime and Vladyslav Sushko",1094
NBER31402,"Remote Work, Foreign Residents, and the Future of Global Cities",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31402,July 2023,"As remote work opportunities expand, more people are seeking residence in foreign destinations.  The resulting surge in foreign residents generates capital gains for property owners but negatively impacts renters and creates potentially important production, congestion, and amenities externalities. We study the optimal policy toward foreign residents in a model with key features emphasized in policy discussions. Using this model, we provide sufficient statistics to evaluate the impact of an influx of foreign residents and to calculate the tax/transfer policies required to implement the optimal policy.  This policy involves implementing transfers to internalize agglomeration, congestion, and other potential externalities. Importantly, we find that it is not optimal to restrict, tax, or subsidize home purchases by foreign residents.","['Joao Guerreiro', 'Sergio Rebelo', 'Pedro Teles']",31402

BIS1092,Mobile payments and interoperability: Insights from the academic literature,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1092.htm,2023-04-25T12:00:00Z,"We connect various streams of academic literature to analyze how alternative competition and regulatory policies may affect the development of digital financial services, and particularly of mobile payments. Our main objective is to highlight the extent to which existing models, often coming from related industries (such as telecom, payments, and banking) can be applied to study the effects of mobile money interoperability. We focus on four dimensions of interoperability."," Milo Bianchi, Matthieu Bouvard, Renato Gomes, Andrew Rhodes and Vatsala Shreeti",1092

BIS1110,Fiscal sources of inflation risk in EMDEs: the role of the external channel,http://www.bis.org/publ/work1110.htm,2023-07-12T12:00:00Z,"We examine how changes in fiscal deficits affect near-term future inflation in a panel of emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Using a novel method for quantile panel regressions with fixed effects, we find that an increase in the fiscal deficit has highly non-linear effects on inflation - that is, a larger impact on upside tail risks than on average inflation."," Ryan Niladri Banerjee, Valerie Boctor, Aaron Mehrotra and Fabrizio Zampolli",1110
