BIS1112,Trust bridges and money flows," Tobias Adrian, Rodney Garratt, Dong He and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli","Cross-border payments are expensive, slow, and opaque. These problems reflect multiple frictions, many of which boil down to limited trust among counterparties. Trust plays a central role in exchanging credit-based money. End users need to trust the issuers of money, and issuers must trust users to satisfy financial integrity requirements.",http://www.bis.org/publ/work1112.htm,1112,2023-07-25T12:00:00Z
CHICAGO2023-23,Preferences over the Racial Composition of Neighborhoods: Estimates and Implications,"Morris A.  Davis, Jesse Gregory, Daniel Hartley","We estimate the parameters of a dynamic, forward-looking neighborhood choice model in 197 metro areas where households have preferences over the racial composition of neighborhoods. Our inclusion of multiple metro areas in the estimation sample enables us to develop a new, shift-share IV strategy to estimate the impact of the racial composition of neighborhoods on location choice that relies only on across-metro comparisons of similarly situated neighborhoods. For the “shift,” we use national data to determine the probabilities different types of households live in different neighborhoods in a metro when neighborhoods are ranked only by within-metro income quantiles. The “shares” are the metro-level population shares of each household type. Thus, the instrument predicts variation in neighborhood-level racial shares, which for a given within-metro income quantile is attributable exclusively to variation in metrolevel type shares. The overall IV estimate is a weighted average of the contribution from all of the income quantiles. We use the tools of Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2020) to analyze the comparisons that are weighted most heavily for identification and to derive appropriate balance tests. Our key finding is that many households have very strong preferences to live in same-race neighborhoods. These preferences are so strong that the current demographic composition of neighborhoods is not stable.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2023/2023-23,2023-23,Jul-23
CHICAGO2023-24,Financial Crises and the Global Supply Network: Evidence from Multinational Enterprises,"Sergi Basco, Giulia Felice, Bruno Merlevede, Martí Mestieri","This paper empirically examines the effects of financial crises on the organization of production of multinational enterprises. We construct a panel of European multinational networks from 2003 through 2015. We use as a financial shock the increase in risk premia between August 2007 and July 2012 and build a multinational-specific shock based on the network structure before the shock. Multinationals facing a larger financial shock perform worse in terms of revenue, employment, and growth in the number of affiliates. Lower growth in the number of affiliates operates through a negative effect on domestic and foreign affiliates, and is concentrated in affiliates in a vertical relationship with the parent. These effects built up slowly over time. Negative effects are driven by multinationals with initially more leveraged parents, who adjust to the financial shock by reducing relatively more the number of foreign affiliates. These findings lend support to the hypothesis of financial frictions shaping multinational activity.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2023/2023-24,2023-24,Jul-23
CHICAGO2023-25,A Comment on Monetary Policy and Rational Asset Price Bubbles,"Franklin Allen, Gadi Barlevy, Douglas Gale","Galí (2014) showed that a monetary policy rule that raises interest rates in response to bubbles can paradoxically lead to larger bubbles. This comment shows that a central bank that wants to dampen bubbles can always do so by raising interest rates aggressively enough. This result is different from the Miao, Shen and Wang (2019) comment on Galí’s paper. They argue Galí’s model contains additional equilibria in which more aggressive rules dampen bubbles. We show that for these equilibria, more aggressive rules involve threats to raise interest rates more than actual rate increases.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2023/2023-25,2023-25,Jul-23

We estimate a quantile vector autoregression (QVAR) for the euro area covering the real economy, monetary policy and measures of ex ante and ex post systemic risk representing financial stability. Policy implications are derived from scenario analyses where the associated costs and benefits are functions of the projected paths of the potentially asymmetric distributions of inflation and economic growth, allowing us to take a risk management perspective. One exercise considers the intertemporal financial stability trade-off in the context of the global financial crisis, where we find ex post evidence in favour of monetary policy leaning against the financial cycle. Another exercise considers the short-term financial stability trade-off when deciding the appropriate speed of monetary policy tightening to combat inflationary pressures in a fragile financial environment.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2833~99c23821b1.en.pdf,2833,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200"

De Santis , Tommaso Tornese","We use a Bayesian Threshold Vector Autoregression model identified through sign and narrative restrictions to uncover non-linearities in the propagation of energy supply shocks. We find that the transmission of energy supply shocks on consumer prices is stronger in high-inflation regimes, supporting state-dependent models. The faster pass-thorough of energy supply shocks to consumer prices (excl. energy) cushions the drop in output in the short term. Energy supply shocks have a stronger impact on output in the medium-term with manufacturing being more adversely affected than GDP. Large energy supply shocks shift the economy to another state but after two and half years the mean-reversion to lower inflation implies a more moderate transmission mechanism, highlighting the importance of state-dependent impulse responses. The energy supply shocks between July 2021 and June 2022 are massive amounting to 3.9 standard deviations on average each month.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2834~db448f2eb2.en.pdf,2834,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 11:00:00 +0200"
IMFWPIEA2023150,Household Savings in Selected Southern European Countries Evidence from Cross-Country Micro-Level Data,"Kamil Dybczak, Shiqing Hua, Mariusz Jarmuzek, Ruifeng Zhang, Yipei Zhang","The paper looks into the puzzle of low household savings in three Southern European (SE3) countries – Cyprus, Greece, and Portugal. Building on the household saving drivers literature, we employ cross-country micro-level data and investigate the key saving patterns, examining their heterogeneity across households in SE3 countries relative to the EA average. The results confirm the prominent role of income, along with interest rate, inflation, fiscal balance, and debt in shaping household savings in SE3 countries. Quantile regressions employed to analyze saving behavior across the distribution of households suggest that households with lower savings tend to see their savings dip (or dissavings rise) more-than-proportionately with shocks to income, interest rate, inflation, and government balance. Our policy simulations across the distribution of households suggest that targeted rather than universal policy intervention could improve household savings, especially of the most vulnerable ones.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/07/21/Household-Savings-in-Selected-Southern-European-Countries-Evidence-from-Cross-Country-Micro-535903,WPIEA2023150,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0400"

IMFWPIEA2023152,Constructing a Positive Shock: Growth Through the Lens of Option Pricing,Mehmet Cangul,"Low-income economies face negative shocks whose frequency and disproportionate impact overcome growth trajectories, producing a negative drift. COVID-19 was the latest such episode. To escape this negative drift, and build a durable recovery, there is a need for acounter-balancing force: to construct a positive shock. Growth is realized through decisions that fall under two categories, routine and non-linear. While routine decisions modify existing economic behavior along the same path, non-linear decisions describe riskier options that involve transformation. Option pricing theory can be useful to describe the latter, and construct the positive shock required to escape the negative drift.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/07/28/Constructing-a-Positive-Shock-Growth-Through-the-Lens-of-Option-Pricing-535088,WPIEA2023152,"Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0400"
IMFWPIEA2023153,Assessing the Impact of Policy Changes on a Nowcast,"Sam Ouliaris, Celine Rochon","Nowcasting enables policymakers to obtain forecasts of key macroeconomic indicators using higher frequency data, resulting in more timely information to guide proposed policy changes. A significant shortcoming of nowcasting estimators is their “reduced-form” nature, which means they cannot be used to assess the impact of policy changes, for example, on the baseline nowcast of real GDP. This paper outlines two separate methodologies to address this problem. The first is a partial equilibrium approach that uses an existing baseline nowcasting regression and single-equation 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�(𝑝�𝑝�,𝑞�𝑞�) forecasting models for the high-frequency data in that regression. The second approach uses a non-parametric structural VAR estimator recently introduced in Ouliaris and Pagan (2022) that imposes minimal identifying restrictions on the data to estimate the impact of structural shocks.

We incorporate flexible beliefs about future fundamentals in a general class of dynamic spatial models, allowing beliefs to be evolving, uncertain, and heterogeneous across groups of agents. We show how to implement our methodology to study both ex-ante and ex-post shocks to fundamentals. We apply our method to two settings—an ex-ante study of the economic impacts of climate change, and an ex-post evaluation of the China productivity shock on the U.S. economy. In both cases, we study the impact of deviations from perfect foresight on different outcomes.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31504,31504,Jul-23

Using the Bank of Israel survey of firms, we document the basic properties of firms’ inflation expectations and examine how Israeli firms update their inflation expectations after receiving new information about inflation or monetary policy. We find that even after successful de-dollarization and disinflation a positive inflation surprise leads to a sizable upward adjustment in inflation expectations for the next year and quarter. A surprise hike in the monetary interest rate leads to a downward adjustment in inflation expectations.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31507,31507,Jul-23
NBER31508,Optimal Monetary Policy with r*,"['Roberto M. Billi', 'Jordi Galí', 'Anton Nakov']","We study the optimal monetary policy problem in a New Keynesian economy with a zero lower bound (ZLB) on the nominal interest rate, when the steady state natural rate (r*) becomes permanently negative. We show that the optimal policy aims to approach gradually a new steady state with positive average inflation. Around that steady state, the optimal policy implies well defined (second-best) paths for inflation and output in response to shocks to the natural rate. Under plausible calibrations, the optimal policy implies that the nominal rate remains at its ZLB most of the time. Despite the latter feature, the central bank can implement the optimal outcome as a unique equilibrium by means of an appropriate nonlinear interest rate rule. In order to establish that result, we derive sufficient conditions for local determinacy in a general model with endogenous regime switches.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31508,31508,Jul-23

The median voter knows whether or not the endorsed candidate is biased toward the elites, but might still prefer the biased candidate if the elite’s endorsement provides sufficient information about her competence. The elite size and the degree of information aggregation by the elite depend on the extent to which the median voter follows the elite’s advice. A higher cost of redistribution minimizes the elite’s information advantage, hinders information transmission, and decreases the expected competence of the elected politician.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31510,31510,Jul-23

More generally, the algorithm facilitates simulated maximum likelihood (SML) estimation of games with large numbers of players, T, and/or many binary actions per player, M (e.g., games with tens of thousands of strategic actions, TM=O(10⁴)). In such cases the likelihood of the observed pure strategy combination is typically (i) very small and (ii) a TM-fold integral who region of integration has a complicated geometry. Direct numerical integration, as well as accept-reject Monte Carlo integration, are computationally impractical in such settings. In contrast, we introduce a novel importance sampling algorithm which allows for accurate likelihood simulation with modest numbers of simulation draws.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31511,31511,Jul-23

Most parents whose children receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits overestimate the likelihood that their child will receive SSI benefits in adulthood. We present randomly-selected families with the predicted likelihood that their child will receive SSI benefits in adulthood. Reducing parents' expectations that children will receive benefits in adulthood does not increase investments in children's human capital. This zero effect is precisely estimated. Likely explanations include parents working more themselves, non-financial goals influencing investment, and families facing investment constraints.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31512,31512,Jul-23

There is a growing commitment to electrification as the dominant decarbonization pathway.  While deep electrification is promising for road transportation in wealthy countries, it will face steep obstacles.  In other sectors and in the developing world, it's not even in pole position.  Global transportation decarbonization will require decoupling emissions from economic growth, and decoupling emissions from growth will require not only new technologies, but cooperation in governance.

Differences in productivity may arise due to a treatment effect of the office or from workers with different abilities sorting into office or home work. We conduct an RCT in the data entry sector in India that exogenously allocates workers to the home or office. We find that the productivity of workers randomly assigned to working from home is 18% lower than those in the office. Two-thirds of the effect manifests itself from the first day of work with the remainder due to quicker learning by office workers over time. We find negative selection effects for office-based work: workers who prefer home-based work are 12% faster and more accurate at baseline. We also find a negative selection on treatment: workers who prefer home work are substantially less productive at home than at the office (27% less compared to 13% less for workers who prefer the office). These negative selection effects are partially explained by subgroups that likely face bigger constraints on selecting into office work, such as those with children or other home care responsibilities as well as poorer households.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31515,31515,Jul-23

Slow learning about the long-run mean can generate forecast bias, a response of forecasts to lagged realizations, sluggish response of forecasts to contemporaneous realizations, and over-reaction to forecast revisions. Introducing behavioral biases, either over-confidence or diagnostic expectations, helps the model further improve its predictions for short-horizon over-reaction and dispersion.

Using monthly state-level administrative caseload data from five large transfer programs–SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, SSI, and UI–and measuring responsiveness in the conventional way as the state-level caseload response to cross-state variation in measures of the business cycle–we find that the safety net response during the Pandemic Recession was greater than occurred during the Great Recession for the most important recessionary-relief programs–UI and SNAP. But we find that the two smaller programs, TANF and SSI, were less responsive during the Pandemic, and we find that Medicaid caseloads are generally unresponsive to the business cycle. We also consider the role of Pandemic state-level policies, such as school and business closures, on caseloads, finding that states with more strict government Pandemic policies had greater caseload increases.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31518,31518,Jul-23
