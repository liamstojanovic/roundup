      <td>The U.S. gross domestic product and its foundational National Income and Product Accounts contain some of the most widely used and followed economic statistics in the world yet contain limited information on the labor market and almost no information on demographic groups. We build a new dataset that includes labor market data cross-classified by sex, age, education, and industry and integrate this into the National and Industry Economic Accounts. To overcome small sample size issues for poorly measured demographic groups, we apply small area estimation to refine the estimates. We present examples of how this data can be used to better understand relationships between economic growth and labor market outcomes by demographic group.</td>

      <td>We estimate across-county spending flows between firms and consumers for every county in the United States, providing a new consumption link that has not been studied previously. We highlight the importance of this link by estimating the effect of changes in local housing wealth on consumption and employment from 2001 to 2019. We generally find that the effect from changes in housing wealth crosses borders to affect consumption and employment in a pattern consistent with our spending flows. However, we find potential consumers who reside outside the local commuting zone disproportionately affect local spending and employment during the Great Recession.</td>

      <td>Rachel Soloveichik</td>
      <td>Early papers on capitalizing data focused on complex digital data that are stored on supercomputers and managed by highly skilled computer scientists (Statistics Canada 2019) (Eurostat 2020) (Coyle 2022) (Calderon and Rassier 2022) (Mitchell et al. 2022). This paper studies two very different types of data: tax forms and individual credit reports. Both types of data are simple text records that can be stored on any computer or even on paper (Brenton 1964) and managed by workers with only a high school degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2022a) (Weedmark 2021). Despite their simplicity, these two data types are expensive to create. This paper estimates that tax forms had a creation cost of $0.4 trillion in 2017 and individual credit reports had a creation cost of $0.6 trillion in 2017.Historical growth changes noticeably when tax forms and individual credit reports are tracked as long-lived intangible assets. Tax form creation rose rapidly between 1929 and 1950 due to the introduction of Social Security and widespread federal income taxes. As a result, including tax forms increases real gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1929 and 1950 by 0.12 percentage point per year. In contrast, real credit report creation plummeted in 1970 due to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). As a result, including individual credit reports decreases real GDP growth in 1970 by 1.6 percentage point. However, neither tax forms nor individual credit reports have much impact on recent GDP growth.</td>

      <td>Tina Highfill, Richard Cao</td>
      <td>Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, disaggregated by number of employees in an establishment, are used to estimate first quarter wages and employment by industry for small, medium, and large businesses between 2012 and 2021. This is the first set of size class estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis that are based on the number of employees at an establishment, or individual business location, as opposed to the total number of employees in a company or enterprise. The distributions of wages and employment by establishment size class tell a different story about the composition and scope of small businesses in the U.S. compared to enterprise-based small business statistics. Establishment-based size classes show almost half (48.6 percent) of 2017q1 wages were generated by businesses with less than 100 employees, but enterprise-based size classes put this share at only 28.4 percent. Additionally, the establishment classification shows only 16.4 percent of wages were attributable to businesses with 500 or more employees, while the enterprise classification shows 52.1 percent, corresponding to the strong influence multi-establishment companies have in many industries. These differences underscore the importance of considering classification when interpreting small business statistics.</td>

      <td>With the recent proliferation of data collection and uses in the digital economy, the understanding and statistical treatment of data stocks and flows is of interest among compilers and users of national economic accounts. In this paper, we measure the value of own-account data stocks and flows for the U.S. business sector by summing the production costs of data-related activities implicit in occupations. Our method augments the traditional sum-of-costs methodology for measuring other own-account intellectual property products in national economic accounts by proxying occupation-level time-use factors using a machine learning model and the text of online job advertisements (Blackburn 2021). In our experimental estimates, we find that annual current-dollar investment in own-account data assets for the U.S. business sector grew from $84 billion in 2002 to $186 billion in 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 4.2 percent. Cumulative current-dollar investment for the period 2002–2021 was $2.6 trillion. In addition to the annual current-dollar investment, we present historical-cost net stocks, real growth rates, and effects on value-added by the industrial sector.</td>

      <td>Measuring the digital economy is a high priority for analysts of economic growth. We augment the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s Digital Economy Satellite Account to include digital services provided by high-tech consumer durables. We find that including the service flow from these goods raises the growth rate of the digital economy between 2005 and 2021 from 6.4 percent per year to 6.9 percent per year. Consumer durable services accounted for about 10 percent of digital economy GDP within augmented digital economy GDP. While most household services are not digital, the household owns a significant part of the digital infrastructure.</td>

      <td>Scott Wentland, Gary Cornwall, Jeremy G. Moulton</td>
      <td>This paper develops a new method for valuing land, a key asset on a nation’s balance sheet. The method first employs an unsupervised machine learning method, kmeans clustering, to discretize unobserved heterogeneity, which we then combine with a supervised learning algorithm, gradient boosted trees (GBT), to obtain property-level price predictions and estimates of the land component. Our initial results from a large national dataset show this approach routinely outperforms hedonic regression methods (as used by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, for example) in out-of-sample price predictions. To exploit the best of both methods, we further explore a composite approach using model stacking, finding it outperforms all methods in out-of-sample tests and a benchmark test against nearby vacant land sales. In an application, we value residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural land for the entire contiguous U.S. from 2006-2015. The results offer new insights into valuation and demonstrate how a unified method can build national and subnational estimates of land value from detailed, parcel-level data. We discuss further applications to economic policy and the property valuation literature more generally.</td>

      <td>Local area data are important to many economic questions, but most local area data are reported using political units, such as counties, which often do not match economic units, such as product markets. Commuting zones (CZs) group counties into local labor markets. However, CZs are not the most appropriate grouping for other economic activities. We introduce consumption zones (ConZs), groupings of counties appropriate for the analysis of household consumption. We apply the CZ methodology to payment card data, which report spending flows across U.S. counties for 15 retail and service industries. We find that different industries have different market sizes. Grocery stores have more than five times the number of ConZs as live entertainment. Industries with more frequent purchases are more local than those with infrequent purchases. We apply ConZs to measuring industry concentration. ConZs give lower concentration levels than counties, with the largest gap for infrequent purchase industries. The difference is economically important. Some industries are below the antitrust enforcement thresholds with ConZs but above them for counties. We further demonstrate the importance of ConZs by analyzing the proposed merger of Albertsons and Kroger.</td>

      <td>Measuring the physical flows of resources and waste between the economy and environment is a central component of environmental-economic accounting as outlined in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), the United Nations standard for environmental accounting.This paper presents a SEEA-consistent proof-of-concept air emissions physical flows account for the United States. Primary data on emissions come from the U.S. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI). The proof-of-concept account covers 2012–2017 and presents tabulated emissions by industry along with examples of additional analytic indicators such as trends in industry emissions and trends in emissions per dollar value added.Primary challenges in constructing this account are (1) adjusting the GHGI data from territory- to residency-based, and (2) attributing emissions to industries and institutional sectors. In this proof-of-concept account, emissions are adjusted to a residency basis using data on the activities of U.S. resident agents abroad and are attributed to industries in proportion to related measures of activity, like fuel purchases or output.</td>
