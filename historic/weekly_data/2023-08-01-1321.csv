NEWYORK1055,Noncognitive Skills at the Time of COVID-19: An Experiment with Professional Traders and Students,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1055.html,February 2023,"Marco Angrisani, Marco Cipriani, Antonio  Guarino, Ryan Kendall, and Julen Ortiz de Zarate Pina",1055,"We study the stability of noncognitive skills by comparing experimental results gathered before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a sample of professional traders, we find a significant decrease in agreeableness and locus of control and a moderate decrease in grit. These patterns are primarily driven by those with more negative experiences of the pandemic. Other skills, such as trust, conscientiousness, and self-monitoring, are unchanged. We contrast these results with those from a sample of undergraduate students whose noncognitive skills remain constant (except conscientiousness). Our findings provide evidence against the stability of noncognitive skills, particularly among professional traders."
NEWYORK1061,"Working Remotely? Selection, Treatment, and the Market for Remote Work",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1061.html,May 2023,Natalia Emanuel and Emma Harrington,1061,"How does remote work affect productivity and how productive are workers who choose remote jobs? We estimate both effects in a U.S. Fortune 500 firm’s call centers that employed both remote and on-site workers in the same jobs. Prior to COVID-19, remote workers answered 12 percent fewer calls per hour than on-site workers. When the call centers closed due to COVID-19, the productivity of formerly on-site workers declined by 4 percent relative to already-remote workers, indicating that a third of the initial gap was due to a negative treatment effect of remote work. Yet an 8 percent productivity gap persisted, indicating that the majority of the productivity gap was due to negative worker selection into remote work. Difference-in-differences designs also indicate that remote work degraded call quality— particularly for inexperienced workers—and reduced workers’ promotion rates. In a model of the market provision of remote work, we find that firms were in a prisoner’s dilemma: all firms would have gained from offering comparable remote and on-site jobs, but any individual firm was loathe to attract less productive workers."
NEWYORK1053,Is the Green Transition Inflationary?,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1053.html,February 2023,"Marco Del Negro, Julian di Giovanni, and Keshav Dogra",1053,"We develop a two-sector New Keynesian model to analyze the inflationary effects of climate policies. Climate policies do not force a central bank to tolerate higher inflation, but may generate a tradeoff between the central bank's objectives for inflation and real activity. The presence and size of this tradeoff depends on how flexible prices are in the “dirty” and “green” sectors relative to the rest of the economy, and on whether climate policies consist of taxes or subsidies."
NEWYORK1063,Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest after COVID-19,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1063.html,June 2023,"Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams",1063,"We modify the Laubach-Williams and Holston-Laubach-Williams models of the natural rate of interest to account for time-varying volatility and a persistent COVID supply shock during the pandemic. Resulting estimates of the natural rate of interest in the United States, Canada, and the Euro Area at the end of 2022 are close to their respective levels estimated directly before the pandemic; that is, we do not find evidence that the era of historically low estimated natural rates of interest has ended. In contrast, estimates of the natural rate of output have declined relative to those projected before the pandemic."
NEWYORK1067,A Measure of Core Wage Inflation,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1067.html,July 2023,"Martín Almuzara, Richard Audoly, and Davide Melcangi",1067,"We recover the persistent (“core”) component of nominal wage growth over the past twenty-five years in the United States. Our approach combines worker-level data with time-series smoothing methods and can disentangle the common persistence of wage inflation from the persistence specific to some subgroup of workers, such as workers in a particular industry. We find that most of the business cycle fluctuations in wage inflation are persistent and driven by a common factor. This common persistent factor is particularly important during inflationary periods, and it explains 75 to 90 percent of the post-pandemic surge in wage inflation."
NEWYORK1051,International Capital Flow Pressures and Global Factors,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1051.html,February 2023,Linda S. Goldberg and Signe Krogstrup,1051,"The risk sensitivity of international capital flow pressures is explored using a new Exchange Market Pressure index that combines pressures observed in exchange rate adjustments with model-based estimates of incipient pressures that are masked by foreign exchange interventions and policy rate adjustments. The sensitivity of capital flow pressures to risk sentiment, including for so-called safe-haven currencies, evolves over time, varies significantly across countries, and differs between normal times and extreme stress events. Across countries, risk sensitivities and safe-haven status are associated with self-fulfilling exchange rate expectations and carry trade funding currencies. In contrast, association with more traditional macroeconomic country characteristics is weak."
NEWYORK1059,Climate Stress Testing,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1059.html,April 2023,"Viral V. Acharya, Richard Berner, Robert Engle, Hyeyoon Jung, Johannes Stroebel, Xuran Zeng, and Yihao Zhao",1059,"We explore the design of climate stress tests to assess and manage macro-prudential risks from climate change in the financial sector. We review the climate stress scenarios currently employed by regulators, highlighting the need to (i) consider many transition risks as dynamic policy choices; (ii) better understand and incorporate feedback loops between climate change and the economy; and (iii) further explore “compound risk” scenarios in which climate risks co-occur with other risks. We discuss how the process of mapping climate stress scenarios into financial firm outcomes can incorporate existing evidence on the effects of various climate-related risks on credit and market outcomes. We argue that more research is required to (i) identify channels through which plausible scenarios can lead to meaningful short-run impact on credit risks, given typical bank loan maturities; (ii) incorporate bank-lending responses to climate risks; (iii) assess the adequacy of climate risk pricing in financial markets; and (iv) better understand how market participants form climate risk expectations and how this affects financial stability. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using market-based climate stress tests that can be conducted using publicly available data to complement existing stress testing frameworks."
NEWYORK1068,Beta-Sorted Portfolios,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1068.html,July 2023,"Matias D. Cattaneo, Richard K. Crump, and Weining Wang",1068,"Beta-sorted portfolios—portfolios comprised of assets with similar covariation to selected risk factors—are a popular tool in empirical finance to analyze models of (conditional) expected returns. Despite their widespread use, little is known of their statistical properties in contrast to comparable procedures such as two-pass regressions. We formally investigate the properties of beta-sorted portfolio returns by casting the procedure as a two-step nonparametric estimator with a nonparametric first step and a beta-adaptive portfolios construction. Our framework rationalizes the well-known estimation algorithm with precise economic and statistical assumptions on the general data generating process. We provide conditions that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality along with new uniform inference procedures allowing for uncertainty quantification and general hypothesis testing for financial applications. We show that the rate of convergence of the estimator is non-uniform and depends on the beta value of interest. We also show that the widely used Fama-MacBeth variance estimator is asymptotically valid but is conservative in general and can be very conservative in empirically relevant settings. We propose a new variance estimator, which is always consistent and provide an empirical implementation which produces valid inference. In our empirical application we introduce a novel risk factor—a measure of the business credit cycle—and show that it is strongly predictive of both the cross-section and time-series behavior of U.S. stock returns."
NEWYORK1056,Workers’ Perceptions of Earnings Growth and Employment Risk,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1056.html,February 2023,Gizem Kosar and Wilbert  van der Klaauw,1056,"In addition to realized earnings and employment shocks, forward-looking individuals are presumed to condition their consumption and labor supply decisions on their subjective beliefs about future labor market risks. This paper analyzes these perceptions of earnings and employment risks using rich monthly panel data. It documents considerable individual heterogeneity in expected earnings growth and earnings growth uncertainty and in the perceived likelihood of a voluntary and involuntary job exit. We examine how these expectations evolve over the working life and the business cycle, and how they co-vary with expectations about the macro economy. Our analysis provides novel evidence on the perceived persistence in earnings growth shocks and on the association between future earnings and spending growth."
NEWYORK1048,Does the Community Reinvestment Act Improve Consumers’ Access to Credit?,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1048.html,January 2023,"Jacob  Conway, Jack N. Glaser, and Matthew C. Plosser",1048,"We study the impact of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) on access to consumer credit since 1999 using an individual-level panel and three distinct identification strategies: a regression discontinuity design centered on a CRA-eligibility cutoff; a comparison of neighboring census blocks; and an event study of changes in eligibility. All three rule out a significant effect of the CRA on consumer borrowing. We show that this is in part explained by a shift in mortgages from nonbanks, which are free from CRA obligations, to banks in need of CRA-eligible mortgages. Our findings underscore the pitfalls of a circumscribed regulatory regime."
NEWYORK1054,Market-Function Asset Purchases,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1054.html,February 2023,Darrell Duffie and Frank M. Keane,1054,"This paper investigates the goals, costs, and benefits of official-sector purchases of government securities for the purpose of restoring market functionality. We explore the design of market-function purchase programs, including their communication, triggers, operational protocols, exit, and wind-down strategies. We further discuss whether, under some circumstances, fiscal buybacks might be a useful alternative or complement to central-bank market-function purchase programs, and how these buybacks could be funded. The use of fiscal buybacks to support market functionality can be aligned with the fiscal authority’s goal of minimizing the government’s interest expense and can reduce challenges that can be faced by a central bank when asset purchases are not naturally congruent with monetary policy. Depending on the setting and circumstances, fiscal buybacks can also mitigate perceptions of risks to the central bank’s independence."
NEWYORK1047,"Financial Sanctions, SWIFT, and the Architecture of the International Payments System",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1047.html,January 2023,"Marco Cipriani, Linda S. Goldberg, and Gabriele La Spada",1047,"Financial sanctions, alongside economic sanctions, are components of the toolkit used by governments as part of international diplomacy. The use of sanctions, especially financial, has increased over the last seventy years. Financial sanctions have been particularly important whenever the goals of the sanctioning countries were related to democracy and human rights. Financial sanctions restrict entities—countries, businesses, or even individuals—from purchasing or selling financial assets, or from accessing custodial or other financial services. They can be imposed on a sanctioned entity’s ability to access the infrastructures that are in place to execute international payments, irrespective of whether such payments underpin financial or real activity. This article explains how financial sanctions can be designed to limit access to the international payments system and, in particular, the SWIFT network, and provides some recent examples."
NEWYORK1058,U.S. Banks’ Exposures to Climate Transition Risks,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1058.html,April 2023,"Hyeyoon Jung, João A.C. Santos, and Lee Seltzer",1058,"We build on the estimated sectoral effects of climate transition policies from the general equilibrium models of Jorgenson et al. (2018), Goulder and Hafstead (2018), and NGFS (2022a) to investigate U.S. banks’ exposures to transition risks. Our results show that while banks’ exposures are meaningful, they are manageable. Exposures vary by model and policy scenario with the largest estimates coming from the NGFS (2022a) disorderly transition scenario, where the average bank exposure reaches 9 percent as of 2022. Banks’ exposures increase with the stringency of a carbon tax policy but tend to benefit from a corporate or capital tax cut redistribution policy relative to a lump sum dividend. Also, banks’ exposures increase, although not dramatically in stress scenarios. For example, according to Jorgenson et al. (2018), banks’ exposures range from 0.5—3.5 percent as of 2022. Assuming that loans to industries in the top two deciles most affected by the transition policy lose their entire value, banks’ exposures would increase to 12—14 percent. Finally, there is a downward trend in banks’ exposures to the riskiest industries, which appears to be at least in part due to banks gradually reducing funding to these industries."
NEWYORK1057,Non-Bank Financial Institutions and Banks’ Fire-Sale Vulnerabilities,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1057.html,March 2023,"Nicola Cetorelli, Mattia  Landoni, and Lina Lu",1057,"Banks carry significant exposures to nonbanks from direct dealings, but they can also be exposed, indirectly, through losses in asset values resulting from fire-sale events. We assess the vulnerability of U.S. banks to fire sales potentially originating from any of twelve separate nonbank segments and identify network-like externalities driven by the interconnectedness across nonbank types in terms of asset holdings. We document that such network externalities can contribute to very large multiples of an original fire sale, thus suggesting that conventional assessments of fire-sale vulnerabilities can be grossly understated and highlighting the value of treating nonbank financial institutions as one organic whole for monitoring purposes."
NEWYORK1064,"Global Liquidity: Drivers, Volatility and Toolkits",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1064.html,June 2023,Linda S. Goldberg,1064,"Global liquidity refers to the volumes of financial flows—largely intermediated through global banks and non-bank financial institutions—that can move at relatively high frequencies across borders. The amplitude of responses to global conditions like risk sentiment, discussed in the context of the global financial cycle, depends on the characteristics and vulnerabilities of the institutions providing funding flows. Evidence from across empirical approaches and using granular data provides policy-relevant lessons. International spillovers of monetary policy and risk sentiment through global liquidity evolve in response to regulation, the characteristics of financial institutions, and actions of official institutions around liquidity provision. Strong prudential policies in the home countries of global banks and official facilities reduce funding strains during stress events. Country-specific policy challenges, summarized by the monetary and financial trilemmas, are partially alleviated. However, risk migration across types of financial intermediaries underscores the importance of advancing regulatory agendas related to non-bank financial institutions."
NEWYORK1046,Assessing the Relative Progressivity of the Biden Administration’s Federal Student Loan Forgiveness Proposal,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1046.html,January 2023,"Jacob Goss, Daniel Mangrum, and Joelle W. Scally",1046,"We quantify the total stock of balances eligible for the Biden Administration’s student loan forgiveness policy announced and examine which groups benefit most. Up to $442 billion in loans are eligible. Those benefiting most are younger, have lower credit scores, and live in lower- and middle-income neighborhoods. We also find that Black and Hispanic borrowers disproportionately benefit from the proposal. We then compare the distribution of beneficiaries for the announced policy to several alternative hypothetical forgiveness proposals and three existing tax credits. The additional forgiveness for Pell grant recipients increased the progressivity of the policy at a cost of $129 billion. Reducing the income eligibility criterion in half from the announced policy would have reduced the cost by nearly $100 billion and made the policy more progressive. Compared to existing tax credits, the announced forgiveness policy is less progressive than the Earned Income Tax Credit but more progressive than the 2019 Child Tax Credit and higher education tax credits. We conclude by describing the remaining federal portfolio if the policy is implemented, and we summarize current credit conditions for federal borrowers. Rising credit card and auto delinquencies for borrowers with paused payments foreshadow future credit difficulties for borrowers if federal loan payments resume without relief."
NEWYORK1052,The Bitcoin–Macro Disconnect,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1052.html,February 2023,Gianluca Benigno and Carlo Rosa,1052,"This paper investigates the link between Bitcoin and macroeconomic fundamentals by estimating the impact of macroeconomic news on Bitcoin using an event study with intraday data. The key result is that, unlike other U.S. asset classes, Bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news. This disconnect is puzzling as unexpected changes in discount rates should, in principle, affect the price of Bitcoin even when interpreting Bitcoin as a purely speculative asset."
NEWYORK1066,Measuring the Climate Risk Exposure of Insurers,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1066.html,July 2023,"Hyeyoon Jung, Robert Engle, Shan Ge, and Xuran Zeng",1066,"Insurance companies can be exposed to climate-related physical risk through their operations and to transition risk through their $12 trillion of financial asset holdings. We assess the climate risk exposure of property and casualty (P&C) and life insurance companies in the U.S. We construct a novel physical risk factor by forming a portfolio of P&C insurers’ stocks, with each insurer’s weight reflecting their operational exposure to states associated with high physical climate risk. We then estimate the dynamic physical climate beta, representing the stock return sensitivity of each insurer to the physical risk factor. In addition, using the climate beta estimates introduced by Jung et al. (2021), we calculate the expected capital shortfall of insurers under various climate stress scenarios. We validate our approach by utilizing granular data on insurers’ asset holdings and state-level operational exposure. Our findings indicate a positive association between larger exposures to risky states and higher holdings of brown assets with higher sensitivity to physical and transition risk, respectively."
NEWYORK1050,Quantifying the Inflationary Impact of Fiscal Stimulus under Supply Constraints,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1050.html,February 2023,"Julian di Giovanni, Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Alvaro Silva, and Muhammed A.  Yıldırım",1050,"This paper builds on Baqaee and Farhi (2022) and di Giovanni et al. (2022) to quantify the contribution of fiscal policy to U.S. inflation over the December 2019-June 2022 period. Model calibrations show that aggregate demand shocks explain roughly two-thirds of total model-based inflation, and that the fiscal stimulus contributed half or more of the total aggregate demand effect."
NEWYORK1062,Estimates of Cost-Price Passthrough from Business Survey Data,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1062.html,June 2023,"Keshav Dogra, Sebastian Heise, Edward S. Knotek II, Brent H. Meyer, Robert W. Rich, Raphael S. Schoenle, Giorgio Topa, Wilbert  van der Klaauw, and Wändi Bruine de Bruin",1062,"We examine businesses’ price-setting practices via open-ended interviews and in a quantitative survey module with business contacts from the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Cleveland, and New York in December 2022 and January 2023. Businesses indicated that their prices were strongly influenced by demand, a desire to maintain steady profit margins, and wages and labor costs. Survey respondents expected reduced growth in costs and prices of about 5 percent on average over the next year. Backward-looking, forward-looking, and hypothetical scenarios reveal average cost-price passthrough of around 60 percent, with meaningful heterogeneity across firms."
NEWYORK1065,Stimulus through Insurance: The Marginal Propensity to Repay Debt,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1065.html,June 2023,"Gizem Kosar, Davide Melcangi, Laura Pilossoph, and David Wiczer",1065,"Using detailed micro data, we document that households often use “stimulus” checks to pay down debt, especially those with low net wealth-to-income ratios. To rationalize these patterns, we introduce a borrowing price schedule into an otherwise standard incomplete markets model. Because interest rates rise with debt, borrowers have increasingly larger incentives to use an additional dollar to reduce debt service payments rather than consume. Using our calibrated model, we then study whether and how this marginal propensity to repay debt (MPRD) alters the aggregate implications of fiscal transfers. We uncover a trade-off between stimulus and insurance, as high-debt individuals gain considerably from transfers, but consume relatively little immediately. We show how this mechanism can lower short-run fiscal multipliers but sustain aggregate consumption for longer."
NEWYORK1060,Applications or Approvals: What Drives Racial Disparities in the Paycheck Protection Program?,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1060.html,May 2023,"Sergey Chernenko, Nathan Kaplan, Asani Sarkar, and David Scharfstein",1060,"We use the 2020 Small Business Credit Survey to study the sources of racial disparities in use of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Black-owned firms are 8.9 percentage points less likely than observably similar white-owned firms to receive PPP loans. About 55 percent of this take-up disparity is attributable to a disparity in application propensity, while the remainder is attributable to a disparity in approval rates. The finding in prior research that Black-owned PPP recipients are less likely than white-owned recipients to borrow from banks and more likely to borrow from fintech lenders is driven entirely by application behavior. Conditional on applying for a PPP loan, Black-owned firms are 9.9 percentage points less likely than white-owned firms to apply to banks and 7.8 percentage points more likely to apply to fintechs. However, they face similar average approval disparities at banks (7.4 percentage points) and fintechs (8.4 percentage points). Sorting by Black-owned firms away from banks and towards fintechs is significantly stronger in more racially biased counties, and the bank approval disparity is also larger in more racially biased counties. We conclude that insofar as automation by fintechs reduces racial disparities in PPP take-up, it does so by mitigating disparities in loan application rates, not loan approval rates."
NEWYORK1049,Sparse Trend Estimation,https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1049.html,February 2023,"Richard K. Crump, Nikolay Gospodinov, and Hunter Wieman",1049,"The low-frequency movements of many economic variables play a prominent role in policy analysis and decision-making. We develop a robust estimation approach for these slow-moving trend processes, which is guided by a judicious choice of priors and is characterized by sparsity. We present some novel stylized facts from longer-run survey expectations that inform the structure of the estimation procedure. The general version of the proposed Bayesian estimator with a slab-and-spike prior accounts explicitly for cyclical dynamics. The practical implementation of the method is discussed in detail, and we show that it performs well in simulations against some relevant benchmarks. We report empirical estimates of trend growth for U.S. output (and its components), productivity, and annual mean temperature. These estimates allow policymakers to assess shortfalls and overshoots in these variables from their economic and ecological targets."
