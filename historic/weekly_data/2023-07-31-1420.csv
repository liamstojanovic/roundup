BFI2023-98,Remote Work and City Structure,"Ferdinando Monte, Charly Porcher, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg","We study the adoption of remote work within cities and its effect on city structure and welfare. We develop a dynamic model of a city in which workers can decide to work in the central business district (CBD) or partly at home. Working in the CBD allows them to interact with other commuters, which enhances their productivity through a standard production externality, but entails commuting costs. Switching between modes of labor delivery is costly, and workers face idiosyncratic preference shocks for remote work. We characterize the parameter set in which the city exhibits multiple stationary equilibria. Within this set, a coordination mechanism can lead to stationary equilibria in which most workers commute or most of them work partially from home. In these cases, large shocks in the number of commuters, like the recent lockdowns and self-isolation generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in dynamic paths that make cities converge to a stationary equilibrium with large fractions of remote workers. Using cell-phone-based mobility data for the U.S., we document that although most cities experienced similar reductions in CBD trips during the pandemic, trips in the largest cities have stabilized at levels that are only about 60% of pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, smaller cities have, on average, returned to pre-pandemic levels. House price panel data by city show consistent changes in house price CBD-distance gradients. We estimate the model for 274 U.S. cities and show that cities that have stabilized at a large fraction of remote work are much more likely to have parameters that result in multiple stationary equilibria. Our results imply welfare losses in these cities that average 2.7%.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2023-98/,2023-98,"Jul 21, 2023"
BFI2023-104,"Exporting, Global Sourcing, and Multinational Activity: Theory and Evidence from the United States","Pol Antràs, Evgenii Fadeev, Teresa C. Fort, Felix Tintelnot","Multinational firms (MNEs) dominate trade flows, yet their global production decisions are often ignored in firm-level studies of exporting and importing. Using newly merged data on US firms’ trade and multinational activity by country, we show that MNEs are more likely to trade not only with countries in which they have affiliates, but also with other countries within their affiliates’ region. We rationalize these patterns with a new source of firm-level scale economies that arises when country-specific fixed costs to source from, or sell in, a market are shared across all the MNE’s plants. These shared fixed costs create interdependencies between a firm’s production and trade locations that generate third-market responses to bilateral trade policy changes.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/exporting-global-sourcing-and-multinational-activity-theory-and-evidence-from-the-united-states/,2023-104,"Jul 24, 2023"
BFI2023-101,The Long-term Effects of Inflation on Inflation Expectations,"Fabio Braggion, Felix von Meyerinck, Nic Schaub, Michael Weber","We study the long-term effects of inflation surges on inflation expectations. German households living in areas with higher local inflation during the hyperinflation of the 1920s expect higher inflation today. Our evidence points towards a transmission of inflation experiences from parents to children and through local institutions. Differential historical inflation also modulates the updating of expectations to current inflation, the response to unconventional fiscal policies, and financial decisions. We obtain similar results in a test with Polish households residing in formerly German areas. Overall, our findings are consistent with inflationary shocks having a long-lasting impact on attitudes towards inflation.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-long-term-effects-of-inflation-on-inflation-expectations/,2023-101,"Jul 24, 2023"
BFI2023-52,Why Did Putin Invade Ukraine? A Theory of Degenerate Autocracy,"Georgy Egorov, Konstantin Sonin","Many, if not most, personalistic dictatorships end up with a disastrous decision such as Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union, Hirohito’s government launching a war against the United States, or Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Even if the decision is not ultimately fatal for the regime, such as Mao’s Big Leap Forward or the Pol Pot’s collectivization drive, they typically involve both a monumental miscalculation and an institutional environment in which better-informed subordinates have no chance to prevent the decision from being implemented. We offer a dynamic model of non-democratic politics, in which repression and bad decision-making are self-reinforcing. Repressions reduce the threat, yet raise the stakes for the dictator; with higher stakes, the dictator puts more emphasis on loyalty than competence. Our theory sheds light on the mechanism of disastrous individual decisions in highly institutionalized authoritarian regimes.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/why-did-putin-invade-ukraine-a-theory-of-degenerate-autocracy/,2023-52,"Jul 26, 2023"
BFI2023-103,ChatGPT and Corporate Policies,"Manish Jha, Jialin Qian, Michael Weber, Baozhong Yang","This paper uses ChatGPT, a large language model, to extract managerial expectations of corporate policies from disclosures. We create a firm-level ChatGPT investment score, based on conference call texts, that measures managers’ anticipated changes in capital expenditures. We validate the ChatGPT investment score with interpretable textual content and its strong correlation with CFO survey responses. The investment score predicts future capital expenditure for up to nine quarters, controlling for Tobin’s q, other predictors, and fixed effects, implying the investment score provides incremental information about firms’ future investment opportunities. The investment score also separately forecasts future total, intangible, and R&D investments. High-investment-score firms experience significant future abnormal returns adjusted for factors, including the investment factor. We demonstrate ChatGPT’s applicability to measure other policies, such as dividends and employment. ChatGPT revolutionizes our comprehension of corporate policies, enabling the construction of managerial expectations cost-effectively for a large sample of firms over an extended period.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/chatgpt-and-corporate-policies/,2023-103,"Jul 24, 2023"
BFI2023-100,Financial Machine Learning,"Bryan T. Kelly, Dacheng Xiu","We survey the nascent literature on machine learning in the study of financial markets. We highlight the best examples of what this line of research has to offer and recommend promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for both financial economists interested in grasping machine learning tools, as well as for statisticians and machine learners seeking interesting financial contexts where advanced methods may be deployed.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/financial-machine-learning/,2023-100,"Jul 24, 2023"
BFI2023-105,Constitutions and Order: A Theory and Evidence from Colombia and the United States,"Leopoldo Fergusson, Javier Mejia, James Robinson, Santiago Torres","We propose a framework to explain why some societies may end up with different constitutional solutions to the problem of maintaining order in the face of self-interested behavior. Though the salient intellectual tradition since Hobbes has focused on how institutional design is used to eradicate violence, our framework illustrates that equilibrium constitutions may in fact have to deliberately allow for violence. This arises because some societies are unable to use institutions to influence income distribution. In this case, a constitutional tolerance of violence emerges as a credible way for an incumbent to meet the participation constraint of a challenger. We illustrate the results with the comparative constitutional history of the US and Colombia.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/constitutions-and-order-a-theory-and-evidence-from-colombia-and-the-united-states/,2023-105,"Jul 27, 2023"
BFI2023-102,Tell Me Something I Don’t Already Know: Learning in Low and High-Inflation Settings,"Michael Weber, Serafin Frache,  Dimitris Georgarakos, Bernardo Candia, Brent Meyer, Olivier Coibion, Tiziano Ropele, Saten Kumar, Geoff Kenny, Rodrigo Lluberas, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Jorge Ponce","Using randomized control trials (RCTs) applied over time in different countries, we study how the economic environment affects how agents learn from new information. We show that as inflation has recently risen in advanced economies, both households and firms have become more attentive and informed about inflation, leading them to respond less to exogenously provided information about inflation and monetary policy. We also study the effects of RCTs in countries where inflation has been consistently high (Uruguay) and low (New Zealand) as well as what happens when the same agents are repeatedly provided information in both low- and high-inflation environments (Italy). Our results broadly support models in which inattention is an endogenous outcome that depends on the economic environment.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/tell-me-something-i-dont-already-know-learning-in-low-and-high-inflation-settings/,2023-102,"Jul 24, 2023"
