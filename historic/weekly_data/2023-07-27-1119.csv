IMFWPIEA2023145,Raising Rates with a Large Balance Sheet: The Eurosystem’s Net Income and its Fiscal Implications,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/07/07/Raising-Rates-with-a-Large-Balance-Sheet-The-Eurosystems-Net-Income-and-its-Fiscal-535549,"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0400","The Eurosystem, having purposefully expanded its footprint in recent years, confronts a period of loss-making as rising policy rates lift the remuneration of bank reserves while assets churn more slowly. This paper projects the net income of the Eurosystem and its “top-five” national central banks over a ten-year horizon, finding that losses, while large, will be temporary and recoupable. The policy conclusions are fourfold. First, the temporary and recoupable nature of the loss-making obviates any need for capital contributions or indemnities from the state, instead allowing losses to be offset against future net income. Second, it must nonetheless be communicated that fiscal impacts will be material, with annual taxes and transfers of 0.1−0.2 percent of GDP giving way to potentially long interruptions in some cases. Third, more-conservative profit distribution policies in the future steady state could help mitigate the on-off pattern of dividends. Finally and most vitally, loss-making must remain orthogonal to monetary policy decision-making, as indeed it is at the ECB. Ultimately, credibility will rest on performance in delivering on the price stability mandate.","['Nazim Belhocine, Ashok Vir Bhatia, Jan Frie']",WPIEA2023145
IMFWPIEA2023140,The Impact of Climate Policy on Oil and Gas Investment: Evidence from Firm-Level Data,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/06/30/The-Impact-of-Climate-Policy-on-Oil-and-Gas-Investment-Evidence-from-Firm-Level-Data-535491,"Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0400","Using a text-based firm-level measure of climate policy exposure, we show that climate policies have led to a global decline of 6.5 percent in investment among publicly traded oil and gas companies between 2015 and 2019, with European companies experiencing the most significant impact. Similarly, climate policy uncertainty has also had a negative impact. Results support the Neoclassical investment model, which predicts a pre-emptive cut in investment in reaction to downward shifts in prospective demand, in contrast with the “green paradox” that predicts an increase in current investment to shift production toward the present.","['Christian Bogmans, Andrea Pescatori, Ervin Prifti']",WPIEA2023140

This paper sets out to understand and quantify the impact of climate mitigation, with a focus on climate-related news, which represents an important information source that investors use to revise their subjective assessments of climate risks. Using full-text data from Financial Times from January 2005 to March 2022, we develop machine learning-based indicators to measure risks from climate mitigation, and the direction of the risk is identified through manual labels. The documented risk premium indicates that climate mitigation news has been partially priced in the Canadian stock market. More specifically, stock prices react positively to market-wide climate-favorable news but they do not react negatively to climate-unfavorable news. The results are robust to different model specifications and across equity markets.","['Yuanchen Yang, Chengyu Huang, Yuchen Zhang']",WPIEA2023141

The greatest challenges are for implementation: crypto’s quasi-anonymity is an inherent obstacle to third-party reporting. Design problems arise from cryptocurrencies’ dual nature as investment assets and means of payment: more straightforward is a compelling case for corrective taxation of carbon-intensive mining. Ownership is highly concentrated at the top, but many crypto investors have only moderate incomes. The capital gains tax revenue at stake worldwide may be in the tens of billions of dollars, but the more profound risks may ultimately be for VAT/sales taxes.","['Katherine Baer, Ruud A. de Mooij, Shafik Hebous, Michael Keen']",WPIEA2023144
IMFWPIEA2023142,Beyond the Annual Averages: Impact of Seasonal Temperature on Employment Growth in US Counties,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/06/30/Beyond-the-Annual-Averages-Impact-of-Seasonal-Temperature-on-Employment-Growth-in-US-534316,"Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0400","Using quarterly temperature and employment data between 1990 and 2021, this paper uncovers nuanced evidence on the impact of seasonal temperature within US counties: higher winter temperature increases private sector employment growth while higher summer temperature decreases it. The impacts of higher temperature in mild seasons, fall and spring, are statistically insignificant. Moreover, the negative impact of higher summer temperature persists while the positive impact of higher temperature in the winter is more short-lived. The negative effects of a hotter summer are pervasive and persistent in many sectors: most significantly in “Construction” and “Leisure and Hospitality” but also in “Trade, Transport, and Utilities” and “Financial Activities.” In contrast, the positive effects of a warmer winter are less pervasive. The employment effect of a hotter summer has been more severe in recent decades.",['Ha Nguyen'],WPIEA2023142

We have three main findings. First, India has made significant progress in reducing poverty in recent decades, but the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to have temporarily increased poverty and inequality. Second, education and employment status seem to be the main factors associated with poverty and  income/consumption changes. Finally, the government’s expansion of food subsidies has likely played a significant role in mitigating the increase in poverty during the pandemic.","['Elif C Arbatli Saxegaard, Mattia Coppo, Nasser Khalil, Shinya Kotera, Filiz D Unsal']",WPIEA2023147
IMFWPIEA2023149,"Shared Problem, Shared Solution: Benefits from Fiscal-Monetary Interactions in the Euro Area",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/07/21/Shared-Problem-Shared-Solution-Benefits-from-Fiscal-Monetary-Interactions-in-the-Euro-Area-535900,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0400","This paper employs two established macroeconomic models to show that fiscal policy in the euro area can help monetary policy in reducing inflation. Specifically, a fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP for two years and 0.5 percent in the third year across the euro area would ease the policy interest rate by 30-50 basis points relative to the baseline scenario, while lowering inflation. It would also put the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path, with the output costs reversing after the second year. Additionally, a stronger fiscal contribution to the policy mix could mitigate financial fragmentation risks. In the current context of elevated inflation in all euro area economies, the findings suggest two key takeaways: first, synchronized fiscal and monetary policies offer gains even when monetary policy is unconstrained and, second, sharing the burden of lowering inflation through fiscal consolidation among euro area members is beneficial for union-wide inflation reduction, improving debt sustainability and inducing a lower policy rate path.","['Robert C.

IMFWPIEA2023146,The Anatomy of Monetary Policy Transmission in an Emerging Market,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/07/07/The-Anatomy-of-Monetary-Policy-Transmission-in-an-Emerging-Market-535467,"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 -0400","Monetary policy transmission in EMs has been found to be weak historically due to under-developed financial markets and heavy central bank intervention in FX markets that undermine the exchange rate channel. Against this background, this paper investigates the transmission of monetary policy, including the role of external factors, in Malaysia and highlight findings that could be relevant for other EMs. We find an important role for the credit and the exchange rate channels. Further, we also find a complementary role for policy tools including Foreign Exchange Intervention (FXI) and liquidity tools such as Statutory Reserve Requirement in shaping the transmission of monetary policy. We then explore the spillover effects of external global factors including global monetary policy and global commodity prices on monetary policy transmission in a small open economy such as Malaysia. The results show that while global commodity prices do not impair monetary policy transmission, global monetary policy tightening could complement domestic efforts to achieve price stability by inducing a global disinflation. Finally, monetary policy transmission is delayed and weakened in high inflationary environment, with the implication that more aggressive and preemptive policy actions may be needed in such cases.",['Kodjovi M.

This is useful information for monitoring the quality of national accounts statistics and supporting identification of areas for improvement. Economies can use this data to benchmark their practices to the region and the world. Many economies have made strides in implementing 2008 SNA to better reflect the size and structure of the economy however, there hasn’t been an assessment on how quick the migration is. With the new 2025 SNA vintage on the horizon, it was imperative to check how many economies are using the 2008 SNA vintage as it will provide a clue to how fast authorities will migrate to the new framework. We found that 31 economies have moved to the 2008 SNA between 2018 and 2021. The paper also examined how many economies started compiling quarterly GDP during the period 2018 and 2021.",['Anthony Silungwe'],WPIEA2023148

Building on the household saving drivers literature, we employ cross-country micro-level data and investigate the key saving patterns, examining their heterogeneity across households in SE3 countries relative to the EA average. The results confirm the prominent role of income, along with interest rate, inflation, fiscal balance, and debt in shaping household savings in SE3 countries. Quantile regressions employed to analyze saving behavior across the distribution of households suggest that households with lower savings tend to see their savings dip (or dissavings rise) more-than-proportionately with shocks to income, interest rate, inflation, and government balance. Our policy simulations across the distribution of households suggest that targeted rather than universal policy intervention could improve household savings, especially of the most vulnerable ones.","['Kamil Dybczak, Shiqing Hua, Mariusz Jarmuzek, Ruifeng Zhang, Yipei Zhang']",WPIEA2023150
