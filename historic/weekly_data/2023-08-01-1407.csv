BOE1029,Yield curve sensitivity to investor positioning around economic shocks,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/yield-curve-sensitivity-to-investor-positioning-around-economic-shocks,"Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","Speculative trading activity may either support efficient market functioning or introduce price distortions. Using granular, daily EMIR Trade Repository data on short sterling futures, we investigate the interaction of speculative trading and macroeconomic shocks on UK yield curve pricing over a 16-month sample period from 2018 to 2020. Our results are largely consistent with efficient market functioning throughout the period, although we find some evidence that short speculative positions amplified yield curve moves in response to Brexit shocks, while long speculative positions had a dampening effect.","Patrick Altmeyer, Lena Boneva, Rafael Kinston, Shreyosi Saha and Evarist Stoja",1029
BOE1025,"Flexible Bayesian MIDAS: time‑variation, group‑shrinkage and sparsity",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/flexible-bayesian-midas-time-variation-group-shrinkage-and-sparsity,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","We propose a mixed‑frequency regression prediction approach that models a time‑varying trend, stochastic volatility and fat tails in the variable of interest. The coefficients of high‑frequency indicators are regularised via a shrinkage prior that accounts for the grouping structure and within‑group correlation among lags. A new sparsification algorithm on the posterior motivated by Bayesian decision theory derives inclusion probabilities over lag groups, thus making the results easy to communicate without imposing sparsity a priori. An empirical application on nowcasting UK GDP growth suggests that group‑shrinkage in combination with the time‑varying components substantially increases nowcasting performance by reading signals from an economically meaningful subset of indicators, whereas the time‑varying components help by allowing the model to switch between indicators. Over the data release cycle, signals initially stem from survey data and then shift towards few ‘hard’ real activity indicators. During the Covid pandemic, the model performs relatively well since it shifts towards indicators for the service and housing sectors that capture the disruptions from economic lockdowns.",David Kohns and Galina Potjagailo,1025

We build a New Keynesian model with borrowers and savers in which quantitative easing and tightening operate through portfolio rebalancing between short-term and long-term government bonds. We quantify the aggregate impact of an occasionally binding zero lower bound in determining an asymmetry between the effects of asset purchases and sales. When close to the lower bound, raising the nominal interest rate prior to unwinding quantitative easing minimises the economic costs of monetary policy normalisation. Furthermore, our results imply that household heterogeneity in combination with state dependency amplifies the revealed asymmetry, while household heterogeneity alone does not amplify the aggregate effects of asset market operations.",Cristiano Cantore and Pascal Meichtry,1030
BOE1026,The potential impact of broader central clearing on dealer balance sheet capacity: a case study of UK gilt and gilt repo markets,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/the-potential-impact-of-broader-central-clearing-on-dealer-balance-sheet-capacity,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 14:01:00 +0100","More widespread central clearing could enhance dealers’ ability to intermediate financial markets by increasing the netting of buy and sell trades, thereby reducing the impact of trading on balance sheets and capital ratios. Drawing on trade‑level regulatory data, we study the netting benefits for UK dealers if comprehensive central clearing had been introduced to the cash gilt and gilt repo markets ahead of the March 2020 dash for cash (DFC) crisis. For the gilt repo market, we estimate that the policy would have reduced the gilt repo exposures on UK dealers’ balance sheets by 40% and, hence, boosted their aggregate leverage ratio by 3 basis points. If that policy had been accompanied by standardisation of repo maturity dates, such that they fell on the same day of the week (apart from for overnight repo), the reduction in exposures would have risen to 60% and the increase in the aggregate leverage ratio to 5 basis points. Such improvements in netting rates would in principle have allowed the dealers’ repo desks to expand their trading during the DFC by 2.5 times more than under prevailing clearing rates for each incremental unit of capital available to them. For cash gilt trades, central clearing would only have reduced unsettled trade exposures for dealers using a particular accounting treatment, but would have done so by up to 80% for that group, boosting its aggregate leverage ratio by 0.4 basis points. However, changes to the computation of the Basel III leverage ratio implemented in January 2023 would also have had these effects on cash trades.","Yuliya Baranova, Eleanor Holbrook, David MacDonald, William Rawstorne, Nicholas Vause and Georgia Waddington",1026

Exploiting regional and firm-level variation in three pandemic policies in the UK, we find that financially healthy firms increased vacancies more in response to positive shocks. Less-leveraged firms and firms with higher credit scores increased postings more in response to the Eat Out to Help Out’s local demand subsidies and after receiving a Bounce Back Loan Scheme loan, respectively. These findings complement the link between leverage and employment losses in response to negative shocks.","David Van Dijcke, Marcus Buckmann, Arthur Turrell and Tomas Key",1033

We use granular data sets – merged across the UK government bond, interest rate swap, options and futures markets – to estimate exposures to interest rate risk at the sector level and for individual funds within the same sector. We focus on non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) such as insurance companies, pension funds, asset managers and hedge funds. We find that NBFIs tend to use derivatives to amplify bond market exposures to interest rate risk, rather than to hedge them. Moreover, interest rate derivatives usage is highly concentrated among a few investors, which could increase the aggregate consequences of idiosyncratic shocks to these investors. We show that this market concentration impedes the monetary policy transmission to asset prices. We also find that monetary policy loosening (tightening) causes NBFIs to take on more (less) interest rate risk via derivatives, consistent with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.",Gabor Pinter and Danny Walker,1032
BOE1027,The transmission of macroprudential policy in the tails: evidence from a narrative approach,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/the-transmission-of-macroprudential-policy-in-the-tails-evidence-from-a-narrative-approach,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","We estimate the causal effects of macroprudential policies on the entire distribution of GDP growth by incorporating a narrative-identification strategy within a quantile-regression framework. Exploiting a data set covering a range of macroprudential policy actions across advanced European economies, we identify unanticipated and exogenous macroprudential policy ‘shocks’ and employ them within a quantile-regression setup. While macroprudential policy has near-zero effects on the centre of the GDP-growth distribution, we find that tighter macroprudential policy brings benefits by reducing the variance of future GDP growth, significantly and robustly boosting the left tail while simultaneously reducing the right. Assessing a range of potential channels through which these effects could materialise, we find that macroprudential policy operates through opposing tails of GDP and credit. Tighter macroprudential policy reduces the right tail of the future credit-growth distribution (both household and corporate) which, in turn, is particularly important for mitigating the left tail of GDP growth (ie, GDP-at-risk).","Álvaro Fernández-Gallardo, Simon Lloyd and Ed Manuel",1027

Next to being interesting in their own right, our findings are informative on the importance of various transmission mechanisms, as they are thought to vary systematically with the included characteristics. Results suggest that monetary policy has greater output effects in industries featuring assets that are more difficult to collateralise, consistent with the credit channel, followed by industries producing durables, as predicted by the interest rate channel. The credit channel is stronger during bad times as well as in countries with lower levels of financial development, in line with financial accelerator logic. We do not find support for the cost channel of monetary policy, nor for a channel running via exports. Our database (containing estimated monetary policy shocks for 177 countries) may be of independent interest to researchers.","Sangyup Choi, Tim Willems and Seung Yong Yoo",1024
BOE1031,The market for sharing interest rate risk: quantities behind prices,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/the-market-for-sharing-interest-rate-risk-quantities-behind-prices,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 14:00:00 +0100","By Umang Khetan, Ioana Neamțu and Ishita Sen

We study the extent of interest rate risk sharing across the financial system. We use granular positions and transactions data in interest rate swaps, covering over 60% of overall swap activity in the world. We show that pension and insurance (PF&I) sector emerges as a natural counterparty to banks and corporations: overall, and in response to decline in rates, PF&I buy duration, whereas banks and corporations sell duration. This cross-sector netting reduces the aggregate net demand that is supplied by dealers. However, two factors impede cross-sector netting and add to dealer imbalances across maturities. (i) PF&I, bank and corporate demand is segmented across maturities. (ii) Large volumes are traded by hedge funds, who behave like banks in the short-end and like PF&I in the long-end. This worsens segmentation, exposing dealers to a steepening or flattening of the yield curve in addition to residual duration risk. Consistent with this, we find that demand pressure, in particular hedge funds’ trades, impact swap spreads across maturities. We also document that long-tenor pension fund trades are less likely to be centrally cleared, adding counterparty credit risk to demand imbalances.","Umang Khetan, Ioana Neamțu and Ishita Sen",1031
BOE1028,The market for inflation risk,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2023/the-market-for-inflation-risk,"Fri, 23 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0100","This paper uses transaction-level data on the universe of traded UK inflation swaps to characterise who buys and sells inflation risk, when, and with what price elasticity. This provides measures of expected inflation cleaned from liquidity frictions. We first show that this market is segmented: pension funds trade at long horizons while hedge funds trade at short horizons, with dealer banks as their counterparties in both markets. This segmentation suggests three identification strategies – sign restrictions, granular instrumental variables, and heteroskedasticity – for the demand and supply functions of each investor type. Across the three strategies, we find that (i) prices absorb new information within three days; (ii) the supply of long-horizon inflation protection is very elastic; and (iii) short-horizon price movements are unreliable measures of expected inflation as they primarily reflect liquidity shocks. Our counterfactual measure of long-horizon expected inflation in the absence of these shocks suggests that the risk of a deflation trap during the pandemic and of a persistent rise in inflation following the energy shocks were overstated, while since Autumn of 2022, expected inflation has been lower and falling more rapidly than conventional measures.","Saleem Bahaj, Robert Czech, Sitong Ding and Ricardo Reis",1028
