ECB2832,Unobserved components model(s): output gaps and financial cycles,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2832~51322fbd6a.en.pdf,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 1","The Global Financial Crisis established that policymakers should consider the stage of the financial cycle to better evaluate the cyclical position of the economy when designing monetary policy decisions. If financial variables are omitted from the estimations of the output gap, a common and unobserved indicator of the business cycle, important financial or external imbalances that may lead to future recessions may not be captured. This paper presents a suite of estimates of output gaps incorporating financial variables. The estimates are based both on small unobserved components models and a large unobserved components model that follows a production function approach. The results show that exploiting the information content of financial variables, which co-move strongly with the output cycle, can sometimes improve output gap estimates. However, these improvements are of a limited magnitude and very sensitive to the choice of the chosen financial variables.","Justine Guillochon, Julien Le Roux",2832,ECB
ECB2828,The state-dependent impact of changes in bank capital requirements,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2828~9c4e7428de.en.pdf,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 1","Based on a non-linear equilibrium model of the banking sector with an occasionally-binding equity issuance constraint, we show that the economic impact of changes in bank capital requirements depends on the state of the macro-financial environment. In ”normal” states where banks do not face problems to retain enough profits to satisfy higher capital requirements, the impact on bank loan supply works through a ”pricing channel” which is small: around 0.1% less loans for a 1pp increase in capital requirements. In ”bad” states where banks are not able to come up with sufficient equity to satisfy capital requirements, the impact on loan supply works through a ”quantity channel”, which acts like a financial accelerator and can be very large: up to 10% more loans for a capital requirement release of 1pp. Compared to existing DSGE models with a banking sector, which usually feature a constant lending response of around 1%, our state-dependent impact is an order of magnitude lower in ”normal” states and an order of magnitude higher in ”bad” states. Our results provide a theoretical justification for building up a positive countercyclical capital buffer in ”normal” macro-financial environments.","The state -dependent impact of changes in bank capital requirements Jan Hannes Lang , Dominik Menno",2828,ECB
ECB2833,Quantifying financial stability trade-offs for monetary policy: a quantile VAR approach,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2833~99c23821b1.en.pdf,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 1","We propose a novel empirical approach to inform monetary policymakers about the potential effects of policy action when facing trade-offs between financial and macroeconomic stability. We estimate a quantile vector autoregression (QVAR) for the euro area covering the real economy, monetary policy and measures of ex ante and ex post systemic risk representing financial stability. Policy implications are derived from scenario analyses where the associated costs and benefits are functions of the projected paths of the potentially asymmetric distributions of inflation and economic growth, allowing us to take a risk management perspective. One exercise considers the intertemporal financial stability trade-off in the context of the global financial crisis, where we find ex post evidence in favour of monetary policy leaning against the financial cycle. Another exercise considers the short-term financial stability trade-off when deciding the appropriate speed of monetary policy tightening to combat inflationary pressures in a fragile financial environment.","Quantifying financial stability trade- offs for monetary policy: a quantile VAR approach Sulkhan Chavleishvili , Manfred Kremer , Frederik Lund -Thomsen",2833,ECB
ECB2822,Are preferential agreements beneficial to EU trade? New evidence from the EU-South Korea treaty,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2822~d0ad211f0b.en.pdf,"Wed, 24 May 2023 1","This paper empirically investigates the effect of the EU-South Korea free trade agreement (FTA) on manufacturing trade flows. By applying a state-of-the-art structural gravity model with intranational (i.e., domestic) trade and using disaggregated data, we quantify both the trade impact and the observed heterogeneity in the FTA estimates. In line with literature, we find that the FTA exerted asymmetric effects in bilateral exports across directions of trade. Compared to previous studies, our findings suggest a different explanation for the poor performances of Korean exports to the EU in the post-FTA period, namely offshoring patterns in electronics and a broad-based decline in the shipbuilding industry. When we drop these two export categories from the analysis, we show that the FTA exerted a large effect on trade in both directions, increasing bilateral exports by about 30 percent. We then investigate heterogeneity in pair-industry-specific estimates of the FTA. The main source of variation is represented by asymmetries in ex ante trade barriers across sectors, with a prominent role for non-tariff instruments. Stronger pre-FTA regulatory intensity is associated to a high liberalization potential, favouring larger FTA estimates.","Beniamino Quintieri, Giovanni Stamato",2822,ECB
ECB2835,"Innovation, industry equilibrium, and discount rates",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2835~f2bfa5dc7b.en.pdf,"Tue, 01 Aug 2023 1","We develop a model to examine how discount rates affect the nature and composition of innovation within an industry. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show that higher discount rates do not discourage firm innovation when accounting for the industry equilibrium. Higher discount rates deter fresh entry—effectively acting as entry barriers—but encourage innovation through the intensive margin, which can lead to a higher industry innovation rate on net. Simultaneously, high discount rates foster explorative over exploitative innovation. The model rationalizes observed patterns of innovation cyclicality, and predicts that lower entry in downturns hedges innovating incumbents against higher discount rates.","Maria Cecilia Bustamante , Francesca Zucchi",2835,ECB
ECB2830,Density forecasts of inflation: a quantile regression forest approach,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2830~81049ee58f.en.pdf,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 1","Density forecasts of euro area inflation are a fundamental input for a medium-term oriented central bank, such as the European Central Bank (ECB). We show that a quantile regression forest, capturing a general non-linear relationship between euro area (headline and core) inflation and a large set of determinants, is competitive with state-of-the-art linear benchmarks and judgemental survey forecasts. The median forecasts of the quantile regression forest are very collinear with the ECB point inflation forecasts, displaying similar deviations from “linearity”. Given that the ECB modelling toolbox is overwhelmingly linear, this finding suggests that the expert judgement embedded in the ECB forecast may be characterized by some mild non-linearity.","Density forecasts of inﬂation: a quantile regression forest approach Michele Lenza , Inès Moutachaker , Joan Paredes",2830,ECB
ECB2826,Firm-bank relationships: a cross-country comparison,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2826~cbbb571758.en.pdf,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 1","We document the structure of firm-bank relationships across eleven euro area coun-tries and present new stylised facts using data from the Eurosystem credit registry -AnaCredit. We look at the number of banking relationships, reliance on the main bank, credit instruments, loan maturity, and interest rates. Firms in Southern Europe borrow from more banks and obtain a lower share of credit from the main bank than those in Northern Europe. They also tend to borrow more on short term, more expensive instru-ments and to obtain loans with shorter maturity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that firms in Southern Europe rely less on relationship banking and obtain credit less conducive to firm growth, in line with their smaller average size. Relationship lending does not translate in lower rates, possibly because banks appropriate part of the surplus generated by relationship lending through higher rates.","Firm-bank relationships: a cross -country comparison Kamelia Kosekova , Angela Maddaloni , Melina Papoutsi , Fabiano Schivardi",2826,ECB
ECB2823,"Asset prices, collateral and bank lending: the case of Covid-19 and real estate",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2823~0a128abbd2.en.pdf,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 1",Our paper uses credit registry data for the euro area to examine how the banking system transmits asset price shocks to credit via revaluation of collateral and subsequent lending decisions. Specifically we examine banks’ treatment of real estate collateral during the Covid-19 crisis. First we find evidence of significant frictions in the trans-mission of asset price dynamics to collateral values. Despite this we find that lending relationships reliant on real estate collateral received one third less credit following the outbreak of the pandemic and that firms experiencing downward revaluations of their collateral were significantly less likely to be given new loans. Our findings confirm that the collateral channel does create an economically significant link between real estate values and credit but suggest that the banking system’s role in transmission may be more complex than traditional economic theory would imply.,"Asset prices, collateral and bank lending : the case of Covid -19 and real estate Aoife Horan , Barbara Jarmulska , Ellen Ryan",2823,ECB
ECB2824,Central bank communication and trust: an experimental study on the European Central Bank and the general public,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2824~446692e8f3.en.pdf,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 1","While it has become clear that communication is a monetary policy tool for central banks, and extensive research has been conducted on central bank communication with financial markets, little is known so far on central bank communication with the general public. My research provides new insights into this field, confirming that the efforts of central banks to connect with a wider public are not in vain. In a randomised controlled trial, I focus on the determinants of trust in the European Central Bank (ECB) and on understanding of its communication about the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, which was set up as part of the ECB’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. I find that the ECB’s simplified and relatable communication leads to greater trust in the central bank among the general public, as it has a positive impact on perceptions of the ECB among laypeople. The simplified content also proves to contribute to increased understanding of the central bank’s messages among the wider public.",Sarah Mochhoury,2824,ECB

First, we ﬁnd that liquidity buﬀers reduced outﬂows during March 2020 only to a limited extent. Second, we ﬁnd that funds entering the crisis with higher liquidity buﬀers were less likely to involve in cash hoarding and more likely to use cash buﬀers to meet outﬂows. Our results suggest that higher liquidity buﬀers can reduce procyclicality primarily through supporting the liquidity management strategies employed by fund managers.","Liquidity buﬀers and open -end investment funds: containing outﬂows and reducing ﬁre sales Lennart Dekker , Luis Molestina Vivar , Michael Wedow , Christian Weistroﬀer",2825,ECB
ECB2834,Energy supply shocks’ nonlinearities on output and prices,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2834~db448f2eb2.en.pdf,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 1","We use a Bayesian Threshold Vector Autoregression model identified through sign and narrative restrictions to uncover non-linearities in the propagation of energy supply shocks. We find that the transmission of energy supply shocks on consumer prices is stronger in high-inflation regimes, supporting state-dependent models. The faster pass-thorough of energy supply shocks to consumer prices (excl. energy) cushions the drop in output in the short term. Energy supply shocks have a stronger impact on output in the medium-term with manufacturing being more adversely affected than GDP. Large energy supply shocks shift the economy to another state but after two and half years the mean-reversion to lower inflation implies a more moderate transmission mechanism, highlighting the importance of state-dependent impulse responses. The energy supply shocks between July 2021 and June 2022 are massive amounting to 3.9 standard deviations on average each month.","Roberto A. De Santis , Tommaso Tornese",2834,ECB

In the RIRBC model, the growth rates of employment, investment, and output are about as persistent as in the data, with an amount of inattention consistent with survey data on expectations. Moreover, consumption, employment, and output move in the same direction in response to news about future productivity. By contrast, the baseline RBC model produces neither persistent growth rates nor business cycle comovement after news shocks.","Bartosz Ma ćkowiak , Mirko Wiederholt",2827,ECB

These surrender options move toward the money when interest rates rise. Hence, higher interest rates raise surrender rates, as we document empirically by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in monetary policy. Using a calibrated model, we then estimate that surrender options would force insurers to sell up to 2% of their investments during an enduring interest rate rise of 25 bps per year. We show that these fire sales are fueled by surrender value guarantees and insurers’ long-term investments.","Nicolaus Grochola , Helmut Gr ündl, Christian Kubitza",2829,ECB
ECB2831,New technologies and jobs in Europe,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2831~fabeeb6849.en.pdf,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 1","We examine the link between labour market developments and new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and software in 16 European countries over the period 2011-2019. Using data for occupations at the 3-digit level in Europe, we find that on average employment shares have increased in occupations more exposed to AI. This is particularly the case for occupations with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers. This evidence is in line with the Skill Biased Technological Change theory. While there exists heterogeneity across countries, only very few countries show a decline in employment shares of occupations more exposed to AI-enabled automation. Country heterogeneity for this result seems to be linked to the pace of technology diffusion and education, but also to the level of product market regulation (competition) and employment protection laws. In contrast to the findings for employment, we find little evidence for a relationship between wages and potential exposures to new technologies.","Stefania Albanesi , António Dias da Silva , Juan F.

ECB2836,Nowcasting world trade with machine learning: a three-step approach,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2836~6b34f0492c.en.pdf,"Tue, 01 Aug 2023 1","We nowcast world trade using machine learning, distinguishing between tree-based methods (random forest, gradient boosting) and their regression-based counterparts (macroeconomic random forest, linear gradient boosting). While much less used in the literature, the latter are found to outperform not only the tree-based techniques, but also more “traditional” linear and non-linear techniques (OLS, Markov-switching, quantile regression). They do so significantly and consistently across different horizons and real-time datasets. To further improve performances when forecasting with machine learning, we propose a flexible three-step approach composed of (step 1) pre-selection, (step 2) factor extraction and (step 3) machine learning regression. We find that both pre-selection and factor extraction significantly improve the accuracy of machine-learning-based predictions. This three-step approach also outperforms workhorse benchmarks, such as a PCA-OLS model, an elastic net, or a dynamic factor model. Finally, on top of high accuracy, the approach is flexible and can be extended seamlessly beyond world trade.","Menzie Chinn, Baptiste Meunier, Sebastian Stumpner",2836,ECB
