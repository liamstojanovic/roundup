BFI202050,Information Aggregation in Stratified Societies,"Marina Agranov, Ran Eilat, Konstantin Sonin","We analyze a model of political competition in which the elite forms endogenously to aggregate information and advise the uninformed median voter which candidate to choose. The median voter knows whether or not the endorsed candidate is biased toward the elites, but might still prefer the biased candidate if the elite’s endorsement provides sufficient information about her competence. The elite size and the degree of information aggregation by the elite depend on the extent to which the median voter follows the elite’s advice. A higher cost of redistribution minimizes the elite’s information advantage, hinders information transmission, and decreases the expected competence of the elected politician.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/a-political-model-of-trust/,202050,"Jul 31, 2023"
BFI2023-107,The (Lack of) Anticipatory Effects of the Social Safety Net on Human Capital Investment,"Manasi Deshpande, Rebecca Dizon-Ross","How does the expectation that a child will receive government benefits in adulthood affect parental investments in the child’s human capital? Most parents whose children receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits overestimate the likelihood that their child will receive SSI benefits in adulthood. We present randomly-selected families with the predicted likelihood that their child will receive SSI benefits in adulthood. Reducing parents’ expectations that children will receive benefits in adulthood does not increase investments in children’s human capital. This zero effect is precisely estimated. Likely explanations include parents working more themselves, non-financial goals influencing investment, and families facing investment constraints.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-lack-of-anticipatory-effects-of-the-social-safety-net-on-human-capital-investment/,2023-107,"Jul 31, 2023"
