Analyzing Bounded Count Data,John Mullahy,"This paper presents and assesses analytical strategies that respect the bounded count structures of outcomes that are encountered often in health and other applications. The paper's main motivation is that the applied econometrics literature lacks a comprehensive discussion and critique of strategies for analyzing and understand such data. The paper's goal is to provide a treatment of prominent issues arising in such analyses, with particular focus on evaluations in which bounded count outcomes are of interest, and on econometric modeling of their probability and moment structures. Hopefully the paper will provide a toolkit for researchers so they may better appreciate the range of questions that might be asked of such data and the merits and limitations of the analytical methods they might contemplate to study them. It will be seen that the choice of analytical method is often consequential: questions of interest may be unanswerable when some familiar analytical methods are deployed in some circumstances.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31814,31814,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023

Assessing the Impact of Structural Reforms on Potential Output: The Case of Morocco,"Hippolyte W. Balima, Olivier Bizimana, Ananta Dua","This paper assesses Morocco’s potential output and the scope for structural reforms to reverse the downward trend in economic performance observed since the Global Financial Crisis. Using multivariate filtering (MVF) techniques, our analysis finds that the downward secular trend in potential growth was primarily driven by the decline in the contribution of labor inputs. We then combine  production function and  general equilibrium model approaches to provide estimates of the potential macroeconomic impact of Morocco’s structural reform agenda. The results suggest that the planned structural reforms could deliver sizable output gains in the medium to long term with reforms that would reduce the large gender gap in Morocco’s labor market yielding the greatest payoffs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Assessing-the-Impact-of-Structural-Reforms-on-Potential-Output-The-Case-of-Morocco-540981,WPIEA2023222,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
China’s Nationwide CO2 Emissions Trading System: A General Equilibrium Assessment,"Lawrence H. Goulder, Xianling Long, Chenfei Qu, Da Zhang","China’s recently launched CO2 emissions trading system, already the world’s largest, aims to contribute importantly toward global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The system, a tradable performance standard (TPS), differs importantly from cap and trade (C&T), the principal emissions trading approach used in other countries.  This paper presents the structure and results from a multi-sector, multi-period equilibrium model tailored to evaluate China’s TPS. The model incorporates distinctive features of China’s economy, including state-owned enterprises and electricity market regulation. It distinguishes between the TPS and C&T and considers a wide range of potential future TPS designs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31809,31809,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Climate Shocks in the Anthropocene Era: Should Net Domestic Product Be Affected by Climate Disasters,"Leonard Nakamura, Brian Sliker","The monetary costs of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. have grown rapidly from 1980 to 2022, rising more than 5 percent in real terms annually. Much of this real growth in costs is likely due to climate change. Regardless of its cause, these costs imply a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events could be included in the consumption of fixed capital, leading to lower levels, and slightly lower growth rates, for net domestic product (NDP). We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and to generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and NDP might be derived from the time series of costs incurred rather than from the far smoother expectation. This latter series might be more appropriate for a national income satellite account. We also investigate the parametric distributions of the annual average-cost and total-cost data.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/climate-shocks-in-the-anthropocene-era-should-net-domestic-product-be-affected-by-climate-disasters,23-24,24-Oct-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,10/30/2023
Corruption Kills: Global Evidence from Natural Disasters,"Serhan Cevik, João Tovar Jalles","Natural disasters are inevitable, but humanitarian and economic losses are determined largely by policy preferences and institutional underpinnings that shape the quality of public infrastructure  (including emergency responses and healthcare services) and govern business practices and the adherence to building codes. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether corruption increases the loss of human lives caused by natural disasters, using a large panel of 135 countries during the period 1980–2020. The econometric analysis provides convincing evidence that corruption increases the number of disaster-related deaths, after controlling for economic, demographic, healthcare and institutional factors. That is, the higher the level of corruption in a given country, the greater the number of fatalities as a share of population due to natural disasters. Our results show that the devastating impact of corruption on loss of human lives caused by natural disasters is significantly greater in developing countries, which are even more vulnerable to nonlinear effects of corruption.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Corruption-Kills-Global-Evidence-from-Natural-Disasters-539659,WPIEA2023220,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Dirty Air and Green Investments: The Impact of Pollution Information on Portfolio Allocations,"Raymond Fisman, Pulak Ghosh, Arkodipta Sarkar, Jian Zhang","We study exposure to pollution information and investment portfolio allocations, exploiting the rollout of air quality monitoring stations in India. Using a triple-differences framework, we show that retail investors' investments in ""brown"" stocks are negatively related to local air pollution after a monitoring station appears nearby, with particularly pronounced effects on ``alert'' dates when air quality is listed as harmful to the general population. The effect of pollution information on investment choices is most prominent amongst tech-savvy investors who are most plausibly ""treated"" by real-time pollution data, and by younger investors who tend to be more sensitive to environmental concerns. Overall, our results provide micro-level support for the view that salience of environmental conditions affect investors' tastes for green investments, and preferences for environmental amenities more generally.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31813,31813,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Do Household Expectations Help Predict Inflation?,"Luis Brandão-Marques, Gaston Gelos, David J Hofman, Julia Otten, Gurnain Kaur Pasricha, Zoe Strauss","We examine whether changes in the distribution of household inflation expectations contain information on future inflation. We first discuss recent shifts in micro data from the US, UK, Germany, and Canada. We then zoom in on the US to explore econometrically whether distributional characteristics help predict future inflation. We find that the shape of the distribution of household expectations does indeed help predict one-year-ahead CPI inflation. Variance and skewness of household expectations’ distributions add predictive power beyond and above the median, especially in periods of high inflation. Remarkably, qualitatively, these results hold when including market-based measures and moments of the distribution of professional forecasts.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Do-Household-Expectations-Help-Predict-Inflation-540829,WPIEA2023224,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Does Wage Theft Vary by Demographic Group? Evidence from Minimum Wage Increases,"Jeffrey Clemens, Michael R. Strain","Using Current Population Survey data, we assess whether and to what extent the burden of wage theft — wage payments below the statutory minimum wage — falls disproportionately on various demographic groups following minimum wage increases. For most racial and ethnic groups at most ages we find that underpayment rises similarly as a fraction of realized wage gains in the wake of minimum wage increases. We also present evidence that the burden of underpayment falls disproportionately on relatively young African American workers and that underpayment increases more for Hispanic workers among the full working-age population.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31818,31818,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Economic Growth under Transformative AI,"Philip Trammell, Anton Korinek","Industrialized countries have long seen relatively stable growth in output per capita and a stable labor share. AI may be transformative, in the sense that it may break one or both of these stylized facts. This review outlines the ways this may happen by placing several strands of the literature on AI and growth within a common framework. We first evaluate models in which AI increases output production, for example via increases in capital's substitutability for labor or task automation, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-replicate”. This typically speeds up growth and lowers the labor share. We then consider models in which AI increases knowledge production, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-improve”, speeding growth further. Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that sufficiently advanced AI is likely to deliver both effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31815,31815,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Environmental Consequences of Hydrocarbon Infrastructure Policy,"Thomas Covert, Ryan Kellogg","We study policies that aim to “keep carbon in the ground” by blocking fossil fuel infrastructure investment. Our analysis relies on a model of hydrocarbon production and transportation, incorporating substitution between pipeline infrastructure and flexible alternatives, like crude-byrail. We apply the model to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which moves oil from North Dakota to Texas and was controversially completed in 2017. Had DAPL’s construction been enjoined, we estimate that 81% of the blocked pipeline flows would move by rail instead. This substitution induces both private costs and local environmental damage, since rail transport imposes greater local externalities than pipelines.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/environmental-consequences-of-hydrocarbon-infrastructure-policy/,2023-138,25-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Expectations and the neutrality of interest rates, John Cochrane,"Our central banks set interest rate targets, and do not even pretend to control money supplies.

GDP revisions are not cool: the impact of statistical agencies’ trade-oﬀ,"Stylianos Asimakopoulos, Magdalena Lalik, Joan Paredes, José Salvado García","Oﬃcial estimates of economic growth are regularly revised and therefore forecasts for GDP growth are done on the basis of ever-changing data. The economic literature has intensively studied the properties of those revisions and their implications for forecasting models. However, it is much less known about the reasons for Statistical Agencies (SAs) to revise their estimates. In order to be timely and reliable, SAs have an explicit interest in not revising their initial GDP estimates too much, while they are much more open to revise GDP components over time. More than a curiosity, we exploit this resulting cross-correlation of GDP components revisions to build a model to better forecast GDP.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2857~073085df17.en.pdf?9e3574dcc780199144161f88d7e297dc,2857,30-Oct-23,ECB,10/30/2023
Heterogeneous Agent Trade,Michael E. Waugh,"This paper studies the implications of household heterogeneity for trade. I develop a model where household heterogeneity is induced via incomplete markets and results in heterogeneous price elasticities. Conditional on exposure to trade, heterogeneous price elasticities imply that different households value price changes differently, and thus rich and poor households experience different gains from trade. I calibrate the model to match bilateral trade flows and micro-facts about household-level expenditure patterns and elasticities. I find gains from trade that are pro-poor and that the average gains from trade are substantially larger than representative agent benchmarks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31810,31810,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Hidden Exposure: Measuring US Supply Chain Reliance,"Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman, Angelos Theodorakopoulos","Supply chain problems, previously relegated to specialized journals, now appear in G7 Leaders’ Communiqués. Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31820,31820,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
How Does Medicaid Expansion Impact Income Support Program Participation and Employment for Different Types of People with Disabilities?,"Ari Ne&#039;eman, Nicole Maestas","Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, the United States’ two primary disability income support programs, each offer a pathway to public health insurance in addition to cash benefits. This implies that expansions in public health insurance availability, such as the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, may impact disability program participation and employment of people with disabilities. However, prior research has yielded mixed results as to the impact of Medicaid expansion on these outcomes. Using a stacked difference-in-differences design and data from the Current Population Survey, we demonstrate that the ACA’s Medicaid expansions increased SSDI receipt among individuals ages 50-64 with physical, self-care and independent living disabilities, consistent with a “job unlock” mechanism. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of the CPS, we show that treatment effects are heterogeneous and concentrated among persons with ongoing disabilities (as opposed to new disabilities) as reported on the CPS’s 6-question functional impairment sequence. We also show suggestive evidence of a reduction in SSI, but find that it is sensitive to specification and data preparation choices, which we illustrate through comparison with other recent work. Effects on employment are inconclusive. Our findings provide further evidence of work capacity among SSDI beneficiaries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31816,31816,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Impacts of Home-Care Subsidies: Evidence from Quasi-Random Assignment,"Yuval Ofek-Shanny, Avner Strulov-Shlain, Dan Zeltzer","We study the impact of subsidizing home-based long-term care on recipients’ health and the labor supply of their working-age children. We use administrative data from Israel on the universe of welfare benefit applications linked with tax records of applicants and their adult children. To address the endogeneity of benefit recipients’ health status, we instrument for benefit receipt using the leniency of randomly assigned evaluators who assess the applicant’s functional status and determine benefit eligibility. We find that for compliers – applicants who receive subsidies only from more lenient evaluators – subsidizing home-based care has large adverse effects on recipient health but no detectable effects on the labor market outcomes of their children. The results are consistent with the crowd-out of self-care for the marginal recipient, highlighting the need to assess the heterogeneous effects of home-care subsidies.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/impacts-of-home-care-subsidies-evidence-from-quasi-random-assignment/,2023-139,24-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Inclusive GovTech: Enhancing Efficiency and Equity Through Public Service Digitalization,Manabu Nose,"How could the GovTech improve budget processes and execution efficiency? Could the GovTech strengthen redistributive function of public expenditure? Based on an event-study method, this paper finds that the introduction of digital budget payments and e-procurement could significantly enhance budget transparency and help expand the coverage of social assistance to reach the most vulnerable population. Exploiting staggered adoption of digital budget payments, a synthetic control regression identifies meaningful increase in pre-tax income shares among the bottom 50th percentile and female workers, especially for emerging market and developing countries, with effects materializing gradually over 10-year period. The paper delves into the potential mechanism driving these equity benefits, highlighting the reduction in business informality as a primary channel. However, the paper emphasizes that the mere adoption of GovTech strategies or digital technologies is insufficient to unlock its full potential. The outcomes are intricately linked to supporting policies, regulations, organizational and system integration, and robust digital connectivity. The paper underscores that inter-agency coordination facilitated by a dedicated GovTech institution emerges as a critical factor for reaping both efficiency and equity gains from GovTech initiatives.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Inclusive-GovTech-Enhancing-Efficiency-and-Equity-Through-Public-Service-Digitalization-540984,WPIEA2023226,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Proponents argue LFOs are a “tax on crime” that funds courts and provides deterrence; opponents argue they do neither. We examine the fiscal implications of lowering LFOs. Incentives to default generate a “Laffer” curve with revenue eventually decreasing in LFOs. Using detailed administrative data, however, we find few defendants demonstrably on the right-hand side of the curve. Those who are tend to be poor, Black, and charged with felonies.

Long Live Globalization: Geopolitical Shocks and International Trade,Serhan Cevik,"Are we really witnessing the death of globalization? A multitude of shocks over the past three years has unsettled the conventional wisdom on economic integration and fueled widespread calls for protectionist and nationalist policies. Using an extensive dataset with more than 4 million observations, I develop an augmented gravity model of bilateral trade flows among 59,049 country-pairs over the period 1948–2021 and find that the much-debated geopolitical alignment between countries has contradictory and statistically insignificant effects on trade, depending on the level of economic development. Moreover, the economic magnitude of this effect is not as important as income or geographic distance and it diminishes significantly when extreme outliers are removed from the sample. The empirical analysis presented in this paper also confirms that the level of income in both origin and destination countries has a positive impact on trade, while the greater the distance between countries, the smaller the flow of bilateral trade due to higher trade costs. Cultural similarities and historical ties are also important in shaping trade flows, just like trade agreements that tend to lead to higher level of international trade.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Long-Live-Globalization-Geopolitical-Shocks-and-International-Trade-540832,WPIEA2023225,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Micro-Assessment of Macroprudential Borrower-Based Measures in Lithuania,"Mantas Dirma, Jaunius Karmelavičius","Despite having introduced borrower-based measures (BBM), Lithuania's housing and mortgage markets were booming during the low-interest-rate period, casting doubt on the macroprudential toolkit's ability to contain excessive mortgage growth. This paper assesses the adequacy of BBMs’ parametrization in Lithuania. We do so by building a novel lifetime expected credit loss framework that is founded on actual loan-level default and household income data. We show that the BBM package effectively contains mortgage credit risk and that housing loans are more resilient to stress than in the preregulatory era. Our BBM limit calibration exercise reveals that (1) in the low-rate environment, income-based measures could have been tighter; and (2) borrowers taking out secondary mortgages rightly are and should be required to pledge a higher down payment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Micro-Assessment-of-Macroprudential-Borrower-Based-Measures-in-Lithuania-540987,WPIEA2023227,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Public Support for Climate Change Mitigation Policies: A Cross Country Survey,"Era Dabla-Norris, Salma Khalid, Giacomo Magistretti, Alexandre Sollaci","Building public support for climate mitigation is a key prerequisite to making meaningful strides toward decarbonization and achieving net-zero emissions. Using nationally representative, individual-level surveys for 28 countries, this paper identifies the current levels and drivers of support for climate mitigation policies. Controlling for individual characteristics, we find that pre-existing beliefs about policy efficacy, perceived costs and co-benefits (e.g., cleaner air), and the degree of policy progressivity are important drivers of support for carbon pricing policies. The knowledge gap about climate mitigation policies can be large, but randomized information experiments show that support increases (decreases) after individuals are introduced to new information on the benefits (potential costs) of such policies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Public-Support-for-Climate-Change-Mitigation-Policies-A-Cross-Country-Survey-540823,WPIEA2023223,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Semiparametric Conditional Factor Models: Estimation and Inference,"Qihui Chen, Nikolai Roussanov, Xiaoliang Wang","This paper introduces a simple and tractable sieve estimation of semiparametric conditional factor models with latent factors. We establish large-N-asymptotic properties of the estimators without requiring large T. We also develop a simple bootstrap procedure for conducting inference about the conditional pricing errors as well as the shapes of the factor loading functions. These results enable us to estimate conditional factor structure of a large set of individual assets by utilizing arbitrary nonlinear functions of a number of characteristics without the need to pre-specify the factors, while allowing us to disentangle the characteristics' role in capturing factor betas from alphas (i.e., undiversifiable risk from mispricing). We apply these methods to the cross-section of individual U.S. stock returns and find strong evidence of large nonzero pricing errors that combine to produce arbitrage portfolios with Sharpe ratios above 3. We also document a significant decline in apparent mispricing over time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31817,31817,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Social Insurance and Migration: Evidence from a Nation-Wide Institutional Reform in China,"Fanghua Li, Chenyang Ji, Moshe Buchinsky","In this paper we examine the causal relationship between formal social insurance and individuals’ migration decisions. We exploit a quasi experimental design in rural China, under which county officials were assigned to a group of villages (i.e., treated villages) to serve as village supervisors (VSs) for the local leaders. We show that this led to reduced favoritism in welfare allocation by the local leaders, thereby increasing the efficacy in the formal social insurance in the treated villages. We use detailed geo-referenced administrative household-level data suited for a spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD) to obtain an average treatment effect (LATE) of the improved social insurance on migration. The apparent variation in the implementation of the reform across treated villages and heterogeneous impacts on different family clans make it possible to directly link changes in the efficacy of the insurance to migration choices. We find a large positive migration effect, of about 19%, for the young males and females. In turn, this led to a large boost in the average household’s income in just two years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31819,31819,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
"Social Unrests and Fuel Prices: The Role of Macroeconomic, Social and Institutional Factors","Alassane Drabo, Kodjovi M. Eklou, Patrick A.

Using the IV fixed-effect estimator on a sample of 101 developing countries during 2001-2020, we find that changes in fuel prices are positively associated with the number of social unrests, mainly anti-government demonstrations. This impact is however amplified: (i) during economic downturns and periods of high exchange rate instability; (ii) when government spending is low, especially on health and education, thus suggesting that streamlining fuel subsides and diverting parts of the reform savings to the health and education sectors is an appropriate policy that could appease social tensions; (iii) in countries with high income inequality, low institutional quality and high level of corruption. The results are robust to a battery of tests, including the use of an instrumental variable approach to address reverse causality concerns given that social unrests could also prompt a freeze in fuel prices. We also find consistent results using either changes in diesel or gasoline prices. Overall, the findings of the paper provide support to the grievance and deprivation theory in explaining the association between fuel price increases and social unrests, but fail to find evidence for the resource theory and the theory of political opportunities.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Social-Unrests-and-Fuel-Prices-The-Role-of-Macroeconomic-Social-and-Institutional-Factors-539677,WPIEA2023228,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

We also find that an equitable counterfactual distribution of vaccines, with vaccination in each country proportional to its population, would have saved roughly 670,000 more lives. However, this distribution approach would have reduced the total value of averted deaths by $1.8 trillion due to redistribution of vaccines from high-income to low-income countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31812,31812,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
The Topography of Nations,Treb Allen,"How does the interplay of geography and political-economic forces affect the shape of nations? This paper presents a quantitative framework for characterizing the equilibrium evolution of national boundaries in a world with a rich geography. The framework delivers simple equilibrium conditions based on the efficient transportation of resources that arise from disparate political economic micro-foundations. I characterize the existence, uniqueness, and efficiency of the equilibrium and provide a simple algorithm for its calculation. When combined with detailed spatial geography data from Europe, the equilibrium conditions well approximate observed borders, and the framework is able to successfully predict the evolution of national boundaries and resulting conflict over the past millennia. Finally, I apply the framework to ask how the changing spatial distribution of resources arising from climate change may alter European borders in the future, finding that the Crimean peninsula and surrounding area is especially susceptible.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31795,31795,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Using Macro Counterfactuals to Assess Plausibility: An Illustration using the 2001 Rebate MPCs,"Jacob Orchard, Valerie A. Ramey, Johannes Wieland","Macroeconomics has increasingly adopted tools from the applied micro “credibility revolution” to estimate micro parameters that can inform macro questions. In this paper, we argue that researchers should take advantage of this confluence of micro and macro to take the credibility revolution one step further. We argue that researchers should assess the plausibility of the micro estimates and macro models by constructing macro counterfactuals for historical periods and comparing these counterfactuals with reasonable benchmarks. We illustrate this approach by conducting a case study of the 2001 U.S. tax rebates, as well as briefly summarizing two previous applications of the methodology. In the 2001 rebate case, we calibrate a two-good, two-agent New Keynesian model with the leading estimates of the household marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of the rebates to construct a counterfactual path for nondurable consumption. The counterfactual path implies that without the tax rebate nondurable consumption spending would have fallen dramatically in the late summer and fall of 2001. Using forecasting regressions and other evidence, we argue that this counterfactual is implausible. When we investigate the source of the discrepancy, we find that the leading MPC estimates are not representative of the response of total consumption.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31808,31808,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Value Added Tax in the Extractive Industries,"Artur Swistak, Nate Vernon","Lower capacity countries often struggle to administer the Value Added Tax (VAT) in the extractive industries, partly due to the large VAT refunds needs of this capital and export-intensive sector. Assuming that the first-best policy (apply the standard VAT to the extractive industry) is not possible in the medium-term, what should countries do? This paper systemically analyzes second-best VAT policy designs considering the impact of the VAT on three key stakeholders: the investor, domestic suppliers, and the tax administration. The analysis concludes that the generally preferred policy is to provide a VAT exemption for imports and either fully tax or exempt domestic supplies, although country characteristics (and, specifically the relative weighting of stakeholders) matter. Moreover, governments should make efforts to shorten refund delays and transition to a standard VAT over the longer-term.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Value-Added-Tax-in-the-Extractive-Industries-540826,WPIEA2023221,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Wars and the Labor Market Outcomes of Minorities in the U.S.,Andreas Ferrara,"This chapter reviews key literature studying the effects of wars on minority and underrepresented groups in U.S. labor markets in the 20th century. These labor markets, characterized by historically pervasive barriers to entry into certain occupations and industries, promotions, and fair pay for underrepresented workers, experienced severe challenges during times of war. These challenges served to break down some of the barriers faced by underrepresented workers. Recent years have shown that sudden labor shortages, similar to those induced by large-scale wars, are not a feature of the past. Hence, a better understanding of such shortages and their effects on different groups continues to be important. The focus here is on the labor market outcomes of Black and white women, as well as Black men, during and after the two World Wars. Their labor inputs compensated for the lack of white male workers during the war years; however, only WWII generated significant and more prolonged socioeconomic progress for both groups. This chapter summarizes theoretical considerations that can explain why some war-induced labor market shocks are persistent while others are not, and the empirical literature related to the labor market experiences of women and Black workers during and after the World Wars.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31811,31811,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
When Institutions Interact: How the Effects of Unemployment Insurance are Shaped by Retirement Policies,"Matthew Gudgeon, Pablo Guzman, Johannes F. Schmieder, Simon Trenkle, Han Ye","This paper shows empirically that the non-employment effects of unemployment insurance (UI) for older workers depend in a first-order way on the structure of retirement policies. Using German data, we first present reduced-form evidence of these interactions, documenting large bunching in UI inflows at the age that allows workers to claim their pension following UI expiration. We then estimate a dynamic life-cycle model and use it to directly quantify how the effects of UI vary with retirement policies. Accounting for interactions across UI and retirement institutions also helps explain otherwise difficult-to-explain trends in the unemployment rate of older German workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31807,31807,Oct-23,NBER,10/30/2023
Why Is Tunisia’s Unemployment So High? Evidence From Policy Factors,"Aymen Belgacem, Jérôme Vacher","Tunisia has one of the highest unemployment rates within the Middle East and Central Asia. We look at the extent to which institutional factors explain those high unemployment levels. We also assess unemployment cyclicality, by looking at the determinants of labor market sensitivity to the output gap. We find that during the last decade the deterioration of institutional factors that affect labor demand explain not only about a quarter of the unemployment rate increase in Tunisia, but also Tunisia’s excess sensitivity of unemployment to the output gap. Our results suggest that an improved business environment and product market competition, increased labor market flexibility as well as reduced financial constraints and informality would help reduce Tunisia’s unemployment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Why-Is-Tunisias-Unemployment-So-High-Evidence-From-Policy-Factors-539628,WPIEA2023219,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
