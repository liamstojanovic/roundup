Analyzing Bounded Count Data,John Mullahy,"This paper presents and assesses analytical strategies that respect the bounded count structures of outcomes that are encountered often in health and other applications. The paper's main motivation is that the applied econometrics literature lacks a comprehensive discussion and critique of strategies for analyzing and understand such data. The paper's goal is to provide a treatment of prominent issues arising in such analyses, with particular focus on evaluations in which bounded count outcomes are of interest, and on econometric modeling of their probability and moment structures. Hopefully the paper will provide a toolkit for researchers so they may better appreciate the range of questions that might be asked of such data and the merits and limitations of the analytical methods they might contemplate to study them. It will be seen that the choice of analytical method is often consequential: questions of interest may be unanswerable when some familiar analytical methods are deployed in some circumstances.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31814,31814,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023

Assessing the Impact of Structural Reforms on Potential Output: The Case of Morocco,"Hippolyte W. Balima, Olivier Bizimana, Ananta Dua","This paper assesses Morocco’s potential output and the scope for structural reforms to reverse the downward trend in economic performance observed since the Global Financial Crisis. Using multivariate filtering (MVF) techniques, our analysis finds that the downward secular trend in potential growth was primarily driven by the decline in the contribution of labor inputs. We then combine  production function and  general equilibrium model approaches to provide estimates of the potential macroeconomic impact of Morocco’s structural reform agenda. The results suggest that the planned structural reforms could deliver sizable output gains in the medium to long term with reforms that would reduce the large gender gap in Morocco’s labor market yielding the greatest payoffs.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Assessing-the-Impact-of-Structural-Reforms-on-Potential-Output-The-Case-of-Morocco-540981,WPIEA2023222,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
China’s Nationwide CO2 Emissions Trading System: A General Equilibrium Assessment,"Lawrence H. Goulder, Xianling Long, Chenfei Qu, Da Zhang","China’s recently launched CO2 emissions trading system, already the world’s largest, aims to contribute importantly toward global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The system, a tradable performance standard (TPS), differs importantly from cap and trade (C&T), the principal emissions trading approach used in other countries.  This paper presents the structure and results from a multi-sector, multi-period equilibrium model tailored to evaluate China’s TPS. The model incorporates distinctive features of China’s economy, including state-owned enterprises and electricity market regulation. It distinguishes between the TPS and C&T and considers a wide range of potential future TPS designs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31809,31809,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Climate Shocks in the Anthropocene Era: Should Net Domestic Product Be Affected by Climate Disasters,"Leonard Nakamura, Brian Sliker","The monetary costs of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. have grown rapidly from 1980 to 2022, rising more than 5 percent in real terms annually. Much of this real growth in costs is likely due to climate change. Regardless of its cause, these costs imply a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events could be included in the consumption of fixed capital, leading to lower levels, and slightly lower growth rates, for net domestic product (NDP). We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and to generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of depreciation and NDP might be derived from the time series of costs incurred rather than from the far smoother expectation. This latter series might be more appropriate for a national income satellite account. We also investigate the parametric distributions of the annual average-cost and total-cost data.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/macroeconomics/climate-shocks-in-the-anthropocene-era-should-net-domestic-product-be-affected-by-climate-disasters,23-24,24-Oct-23,FED-PHILADELPHIA,10/30/2023
Corruption Kills: Global Evidence from Natural Disasters,"Serhan Cevik, João Tovar Jalles","Natural disasters are inevitable, but humanitarian and economic losses are determined largely by policy preferences and institutional underpinnings that shape the quality of public infrastructure  (including emergency responses and healthcare services) and govern business practices and the adherence to building codes. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether corruption increases the loss of human lives caused by natural disasters, using a large panel of 135 countries during the period 1980–2020. The econometric analysis provides convincing evidence that corruption increases the number of disaster-related deaths, after controlling for economic, demographic, healthcare and institutional factors. That is, the higher the level of corruption in a given country, the greater the number of fatalities as a share of population due to natural disasters. Our results show that the devastating impact of corruption on loss of human lives caused by natural disasters is significantly greater in developing countries, which are even more vulnerable to nonlinear effects of corruption.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Corruption-Kills-Global-Evidence-from-Natural-Disasters-539659,WPIEA2023220,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Dirty Air and Green Investments: The Impact of Pollution Information on Portfolio Allocations,"Raymond Fisman, Pulak Ghosh, Arkodipta Sarkar, Jian Zhang","We study exposure to pollution information and investment portfolio allocations, exploiting the rollout of air quality monitoring stations in India. Using a triple-differences framework, we show that retail investors' investments in ""brown"" stocks are negatively related to local air pollution after a monitoring station appears nearby, with particularly pronounced effects on ``alert'' dates when air quality is listed as harmful to the general population. The effect of pollution information on investment choices is most prominent amongst tech-savvy investors who are most plausibly ""treated"" by real-time pollution data, and by younger investors who tend to be more sensitive to environmental concerns. Overall, our results provide micro-level support for the view that salience of environmental conditions affect investors' tastes for green investments, and preferences for environmental amenities more generally.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31813,31813,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Do Household Expectations Help Predict Inflation?,"Luis Brandão-Marques, Gaston Gelos, David J Hofman, Julia Otten, Gurnain Kaur Pasricha, Zoe Strauss","We examine whether changes in the distribution of household inflation expectations contain information on future inflation. We first discuss recent shifts in micro data from the US, UK, Germany, and Canada. We then zoom in on the US to explore econometrically whether distributional characteristics help predict future inflation. We find that the shape of the distribution of household expectations does indeed help predict one-year-ahead CPI inflation. Variance and skewness of household expectations’ distributions add predictive power beyond and above the median, especially in periods of high inflation. Remarkably, qualitatively, these results hold when including market-based measures and moments of the distribution of professional forecasts.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Do-Household-Expectations-Help-Predict-Inflation-540829,WPIEA2023224,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Does Wage Theft Vary by Demographic Group? Evidence from Minimum Wage Increases,"Jeffrey Clemens, Michael R. Strain","Using Current Population Survey data, we assess whether and to what extent the burden of wage theft — wage payments below the statutory minimum wage — falls disproportionately on various demographic groups following minimum wage increases. For most racial and ethnic groups at most ages we find that underpayment rises similarly as a fraction of realized wage gains in the wake of minimum wage increases. We also present evidence that the burden of underpayment falls disproportionately on relatively young African American workers and that underpayment increases more for Hispanic workers among the full working-age population.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31818,31818,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Economic Growth under Transformative AI,"Philip Trammell, Anton Korinek","Industrialized countries have long seen relatively stable growth in output per capita and a stable labor share. AI may be transformative, in the sense that it may break one or both of these stylized facts. This review outlines the ways this may happen by placing several strands of the literature on AI and growth within a common framework. We first evaluate models in which AI increases output production, for example via increases in capital's substitutability for labor or task automation, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-replicate”. This typically speeds up growth and lowers the labor share. We then consider models in which AI increases knowledge production, capturing the notion that AI will let capital “self-improve”, speeding growth further. Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that sufficiently advanced AI is likely to deliver both effects.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31815,31815,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Environmental Consequences of Hydrocarbon Infrastructure Policy,"Thomas Covert, Ryan Kellogg","We study policies that aim to “keep carbon in the ground” by blocking fossil fuel infrastructure investment. Our analysis relies on a model of hydrocarbon production and transportation, incorporating substitution between pipeline infrastructure and flexible alternatives, like crude-byrail. We apply the model to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which moves oil from North Dakota to Texas and was controversially completed in 2017. Had DAPL’s construction been enjoined, we estimate that 81% of the blocked pipeline flows would move by rail instead. This substitution induces both private costs and local environmental damage, since rail transport imposes greater local externalities than pipelines.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/environmental-consequences-of-hydrocarbon-infrastructure-policy/,2023-138,25-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Expectations and the neutrality of interest rates, John Cochrane,"Our central banks set interest rate targets, and do not even pretend to control money supplies.

GDP revisions are not cool: the impact of statistical agencies’ trade-oﬀ,"Stylianos Asimakopoulos, Magdalena Lalik, Joan Paredes, José Salvado García","Oﬃcial estimates of economic growth are regularly revised and therefore forecasts for GDP growth are done on the basis of ever-changing data. The economic literature has intensively studied the properties of those revisions and their implications for forecasting models. However, it is much less known about the reasons for Statistical Agencies (SAs) to revise their estimates. In order to be timely and reliable, SAs have an explicit interest in not revising their initial GDP estimates too much, while they are much more open to revise GDP components over time. More than a curiosity, we exploit this resulting cross-correlation of GDP components revisions to build a model to better forecast GDP.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2857~073085df17.en.pdf?9e3574dcc780199144161f88d7e297dc,2857,30-Oct-23,ECB,10/30/2023
Heterogeneous Agent Trade,Michael E. Waugh,"This paper studies the implications of household heterogeneity for trade. I develop a model where household heterogeneity is induced via incomplete markets and results in heterogeneous price elasticities. Conditional on exposure to trade, heterogeneous price elasticities imply that different households value price changes differently, and thus rich and poor households experience different gains from trade. I calibrate the model to match bilateral trade flows and micro-facts about household-level expenditure patterns and elasticities. I find gains from trade that are pro-poor and that the average gains from trade are substantially larger than representative agent benchmarks.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31810,31810,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Hidden Exposure: Measuring US Supply Chain Reliance,"Richard Baldwin, Rebecca Freeman, Angelos Theodorakopoulos","Supply chain problems, previously relegated to specialized journals, now appear in G7 Leaders’ Communiqués. Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31820,31820,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
How Does Medicaid Expansion Impact Income Support Program Participation and Employment for Different Types of People with Disabilities?,"Ari Ne&#039;eman, Nicole Maestas","Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, the United States’ two primary disability income support programs, each offer a pathway to public health insurance in addition to cash benefits. This implies that expansions in public health insurance availability, such as the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, may impact disability program participation and employment of people with disabilities. However, prior research has yielded mixed results as to the impact of Medicaid expansion on these outcomes. Using a stacked difference-in-differences design and data from the Current Population Survey, we demonstrate that the ACA’s Medicaid expansions increased SSDI receipt among individuals ages 50-64 with physical, self-care and independent living disabilities, consistent with a “job unlock” mechanism. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of the CPS, we show that treatment effects are heterogeneous and concentrated among persons with ongoing disabilities (as opposed to new disabilities) as reported on the CPS’s 6-question functional impairment sequence. We also show suggestive evidence of a reduction in SSI, but find that it is sensitive to specification and data preparation choices, which we illustrate through comparison with other recent work. Effects on employment are inconclusive. Our findings provide further evidence of work capacity among SSDI beneficiaries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31816,31816,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Impacts of Home-Care Subsidies: Evidence from Quasi-Random Assignment,"Yuval Ofek-Shanny, Avner Strulov-Shlain, Dan Zeltzer","We study the impact of subsidizing home-based long-term care on recipients’ health and the labor supply of their working-age children. We use administrative data from Israel on the universe of welfare benefit applications linked with tax records of applicants and their adult children. To address the endogeneity of benefit recipients’ health status, we instrument for benefit receipt using the leniency of randomly assigned evaluators who assess the applicant’s functional status and determine benefit eligibility. We find that for compliers – applicants who receive subsidies only from more lenient evaluators – subsidizing home-based care has large adverse effects on recipient health but no detectable effects on the labor market outcomes of their children. The results are consistent with the crowd-out of self-care for the marginal recipient, highlighting the need to assess the heterogeneous effects of home-care subsidies.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/impacts-of-home-care-subsidies-evidence-from-quasi-random-assignment/,2023-139,24-Oct-23,BFI,10/30/2023
Inclusive GovTech: Enhancing Efficiency and Equity Through Public Service Digitalization,Manabu Nose,"How could the GovTech improve budget processes and execution efficiency? Could the GovTech strengthen redistributive function of public expenditure? Based on an event-study method, this paper finds that the introduction of digital budget payments and e-procurement could significantly enhance budget transparency and help expand the coverage of social assistance to reach the most vulnerable population. Exploiting staggered adoption of digital budget payments, a synthetic control regression identifies meaningful increase in pre-tax income shares among the bottom 50th percentile and female workers, especially for emerging market and developing countries, with effects materializing gradually over 10-year period. The paper delves into the potential mechanism driving these equity benefits, highlighting the reduction in business informality as a primary channel. However, the paper emphasizes that the mere adoption of GovTech strategies or digital technologies is insufficient to unlock its full potential. The outcomes are intricately linked to supporting policies, regulations, organizational and system integration, and robust digital connectivity. The paper underscores that inter-agency coordination facilitated by a dedicated GovTech institution emerges as a critical factor for reaping both efficiency and equity gains from GovTech initiatives.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Inclusive-GovTech-Enhancing-Efficiency-and-Equity-Through-Public-Service-Digitalization-540984,WPIEA2023226,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Laffer’s Day in Court: The Revenue Effects  of Criminal Justice Fees and Fines,"Samuel Norris, Evan K.

Proponents argue LFOs are a “tax on crime” that funds courts and provides deterrence; opponents argue they do neither. We examine the fiscal implications of lowering LFOs. Incentives to default generate a “Laffer” curve with revenue eventually decreasing in LFOs. Using detailed administrative data, however, we find few defendants demonstrably on the right-hand side of the curve. Those who are tend to be poor, Black, and charged with felonies.

Long Live Globalization: Geopolitical Shocks and International Trade,Serhan Cevik,"Are we really witnessing the death of globalization? A multitude of shocks over the past three years has unsettled the conventional wisdom on economic integration and fueled widespread calls for protectionist and nationalist policies. Using an extensive dataset with more than 4 million observations, I develop an augmented gravity model of bilateral trade flows among 59,049 country-pairs over the period 1948–2021 and find that the much-debated geopolitical alignment between countries has contradictory and statistically insignificant effects on trade, depending on the level of economic development. Moreover, the economic magnitude of this effect is not as important as income or geographic distance and it diminishes significantly when extreme outliers are removed from the sample. The empirical analysis presented in this paper also confirms that the level of income in both origin and destination countries has a positive impact on trade, while the greater the distance between countries, the smaller the flow of bilateral trade due to higher trade costs. Cultural similarities and historical ties are also important in shaping trade flows, just like trade agreements that tend to lead to higher level of international trade.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Long-Live-Globalization-Geopolitical-Shocks-and-International-Trade-540832,WPIEA2023225,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Micro-Assessment of Macroprudential Borrower-Based Measures in Lithuania,"Mantas Dirma, Jaunius Karmelavičius","Despite having introduced borrower-based measures (BBM), Lithuania's housing and mortgage markets were booming during the low-interest-rate period, casting doubt on the macroprudential toolkit's ability to contain excessive mortgage growth. This paper assesses the adequacy of BBMs’ parametrization in Lithuania. We do so by building a novel lifetime expected credit loss framework that is founded on actual loan-level default and household income data. We show that the BBM package effectively contains mortgage credit risk and that housing loans are more resilient to stress than in the preregulatory era. Our BBM limit calibration exercise reveals that (1) in the low-rate environment, income-based measures could have been tighter; and (2) borrowers taking out secondary mortgages rightly are and should be required to pledge a higher down payment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Micro-Assessment-of-Macroprudential-Borrower-Based-Measures-in-Lithuania-540987,WPIEA2023227,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Public Support for Climate Change Mitigation Policies: A Cross Country Survey,"Era Dabla-Norris, Salma Khalid, Giacomo Magistretti, Alexandre Sollaci","Building public support for climate mitigation is a key prerequisite to making meaningful strides toward decarbonization and achieving net-zero emissions. Using nationally representative, individual-level surveys for 28 countries, this paper identifies the current levels and drivers of support for climate mitigation policies. Controlling for individual characteristics, we find that pre-existing beliefs about policy efficacy, perceived costs and co-benefits (e.g., cleaner air), and the degree of policy progressivity are important drivers of support for carbon pricing policies. The knowledge gap about climate mitigation policies can be large, but randomized information experiments show that support increases (decreases) after individuals are introduced to new information on the benefits (potential costs) of such policies.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Public-Support-for-Climate-Change-Mitigation-Policies-A-Cross-Country-Survey-540823,WPIEA2023223,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Semiparametric Conditional Factor Models: Estimation and Inference,"Qihui Chen, Nikolai Roussanov, Xiaoliang Wang","This paper introduces a simple and tractable sieve estimation of semiparametric conditional factor models with latent factors. We establish large-N-asymptotic properties of the estimators without requiring large T. We also develop a simple bootstrap procedure for conducting inference about the conditional pricing errors as well as the shapes of the factor loading functions. These results enable us to estimate conditional factor structure of a large set of individual assets by utilizing arbitrary nonlinear functions of a number of characteristics without the need to pre-specify the factors, while allowing us to disentangle the characteristics' role in capturing factor betas from alphas (i.e., undiversifiable risk from mispricing). We apply these methods to the cross-section of individual U.S. stock returns and find strong evidence of large nonzero pricing errors that combine to produce arbitrage portfolios with Sharpe ratios above 3. We also document a significant decline in apparent mispricing over time.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31817,31817,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Social Insurance and Migration: Evidence from a Nation-Wide Institutional Reform in China,"Fanghua Li, Chenyang Ji, Moshe Buchinsky","In this paper we examine the causal relationship between formal social insurance and individuals’ migration decisions. We exploit a quasi experimental design in rural China, under which county officials were assigned to a group of villages (i.e., treated villages) to serve as village supervisors (VSs) for the local leaders. We show that this led to reduced favoritism in welfare allocation by the local leaders, thereby increasing the efficacy in the formal social insurance in the treated villages. We use detailed geo-referenced administrative household-level data suited for a spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD) to obtain an average treatment effect (LATE) of the improved social insurance on migration. The apparent variation in the implementation of the reform across treated villages and heterogeneous impacts on different family clans make it possible to directly link changes in the efficacy of the insurance to migration choices. We find a large positive migration effect, of about 19%, for the young males and females. In turn, this led to a large boost in the average household’s income in just two years.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31819,31819,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
"Social Unrests and Fuel Prices: The Role of Macroeconomic, Social and Institutional Factors","Alassane Drabo, Kodjovi M. Eklou, Patrick A.

Using the IV fixed-effect estimator on a sample of 101 developing countries during 2001-2020, we find that changes in fuel prices are positively associated with the number of social unrests, mainly anti-government demonstrations. This impact is however amplified: (i) during economic downturns and periods of high exchange rate instability; (ii) when government spending is low, especially on health and education, thus suggesting that streamlining fuel subsides and diverting parts of the reform savings to the health and education sectors is an appropriate policy that could appease social tensions; (iii) in countries with high income inequality, low institutional quality and high level of corruption. The results are robust to a battery of tests, including the use of an instrumental variable approach to address reverse causality concerns given that social unrests could also prompt a freeze in fuel prices. We also find consistent results using either changes in diesel or gasoline prices. Overall, the findings of the paper provide support to the grievance and deprivation theory in explaining the association between fuel price increases and social unrests, but fail to find evidence for the resource theory and the theory of political opportunities.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Social-Unrests-and-Fuel-Prices-The-Role-of-Macroeconomic-Social-and-Institutional-Factors-539677,WPIEA2023228,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

Nevertheless, the impact of this campaign on all-cause mortality is not well understood. Leveraging the staggered rollout of vaccines, we find that the vaccination campaign across 141 countries averted 2.4 million excess deaths, valued at $6.5 trillion. We also find that an equitable counterfactual distribution of vaccines, with vaccination in each country proportional to its population, would have saved roughly 670,000 more lives. However, this distribution approach would have reduced the total value of averted deaths by $1.8 trillion due to redistribution of vaccines from high-income to low-income countries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31812,31812,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
The Topography of Nations,Treb Allen,"How does the interplay of geography and political-economic forces affect the shape of nations? This paper presents a quantitative framework for characterizing the equilibrium evolution of national boundaries in a world with a rich geography. The framework delivers simple equilibrium conditions based on the efficient transportation of resources that arise from disparate political economic micro-foundations. I characterize the existence, uniqueness, and efficiency of the equilibrium and provide a simple algorithm for its calculation. When combined with detailed spatial geography data from Europe, the equilibrium conditions well approximate observed borders, and the framework is able to successfully predict the evolution of national boundaries and resulting conflict over the past millennia. Finally, I apply the framework to ask how the changing spatial distribution of resources arising from climate change may alter European borders in the future, finding that the Crimean peninsula and surrounding area is especially susceptible.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31795,31795,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Using Macro Counterfactuals to Assess Plausibility: An Illustration using the 2001 Rebate MPCs,"Jacob Orchard, Valerie A. Ramey, Johannes Wieland","Macroeconomics has increasingly adopted tools from the applied micro “credibility revolution” to estimate micro parameters that can inform macro questions. In this paper, we argue that researchers should take advantage of this confluence of micro and macro to take the credibility revolution one step further. We argue that researchers should assess the plausibility of the micro estimates and macro models by constructing macro counterfactuals for historical periods and comparing these counterfactuals with reasonable benchmarks. We illustrate this approach by conducting a case study of the 2001 U.S. tax rebates, as well as briefly summarizing two previous applications of the methodology. In the 2001 rebate case, we calibrate a two-good, two-agent New Keynesian model with the leading estimates of the household marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of the rebates to construct a counterfactual path for nondurable consumption. The counterfactual path implies that without the tax rebate nondurable consumption spending would have fallen dramatically in the late summer and fall of 2001. Using forecasting regressions and other evidence, we argue that this counterfactual is implausible. When we investigate the source of the discrepancy, we find that the leading MPC estimates are not representative of the response of total consumption.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31808,31808,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Value Added Tax in the Extractive Industries,"Artur Swistak, Nate Vernon","Lower capacity countries often struggle to administer the Value Added Tax (VAT) in the extractive industries, partly due to the large VAT refunds needs of this capital and export-intensive sector. Assuming that the first-best policy (apply the standard VAT to the extractive industry) is not possible in the medium-term, what should countries do? This paper systemically analyzes second-best VAT policy designs considering the impact of the VAT on three key stakeholders: the investor, domestic suppliers, and the tax administration. The analysis concludes that the generally preferred policy is to provide a VAT exemption for imports and either fully tax or exempt domestic supplies, although country characteristics (and, specifically the relative weighting of stakeholders) matter. Moreover, governments should make efforts to shorten refund delays and transition to a standard VAT over the longer-term.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Value-Added-Tax-in-the-Extractive-Industries-540826,WPIEA2023221,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023
Wars and the Labor Market Outcomes of Minorities in the U.S.,Andreas Ferrara,"This chapter reviews key literature studying the effects of wars on minority and underrepresented groups in U.S. labor markets in the 20th century. These labor markets, characterized by historically pervasive barriers to entry into certain occupations and industries, promotions, and fair pay for underrepresented workers, experienced severe challenges during times of war. These challenges served to break down some of the barriers faced by underrepresented workers. Recent years have shown that sudden labor shortages, similar to those induced by large-scale wars, are not a feature of the past. Hence, a better understanding of such shortages and their effects on different groups continues to be important. The focus here is on the labor market outcomes of Black and white women, as well as Black men, during and after the two World Wars. Their labor inputs compensated for the lack of white male workers during the war years; however, only WWII generated significant and more prolonged socioeconomic progress for both groups. This chapter summarizes theoretical considerations that can explain why some war-induced labor market shocks are persistent while others are not, and the empirical literature related to the labor market experiences of women and Black workers during and after the World Wars.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31811,31811,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
When Institutions Interact: How the Effects of Unemployment Insurance are Shaped by Retirement Policies,"Matthew Gudgeon, Pablo Guzman, Johannes F. Schmieder, Simon Trenkle, Han Ye","This paper shows empirically that the non-employment effects of unemployment insurance (UI) for older workers depend in a first-order way on the structure of retirement policies. Using German data, we first present reduced-form evidence of these interactions, documenting large bunching in UI inflows at the age that allows workers to claim their pension following UI expiration. We then estimate a dynamic life-cycle model and use it to directly quantify how the effects of UI vary with retirement policies. Accounting for interactions across UI and retirement institutions also helps explain otherwise difficult-to-explain trends in the unemployment rate of older German workers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31807,31807,23-Oct,NBER,10/30/2023
Why Is Tunisia’s Unemployment So High? Evidence From Policy Factors,"Aymen Belgacem, Jérôme Vacher","Tunisia has one of the highest unemployment rates within the Middle East and Central Asia. We look at the extent to which institutional factors explain those high unemployment levels. We also assess unemployment cyclicality, by looking at the determinants of labor market sensitivity to the output gap. We find that during the last decade the deterioration of institutional factors that affect labor demand explain not only about a quarter of the unemployment rate increase in Tunisia, but also Tunisia’s excess sensitivity of unemployment to the output gap. Our results suggest that an improved business environment and product market competition, increased labor market flexibility as well as reduced financial constraints and informality would help reduce Tunisia’s unemployment.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/10/27/Why-Is-Tunisias-Unemployment-So-High-Evidence-From-Policy-Factors-539628,WPIEA2023219,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 ",IMF,10/30/2023

China’s footprint in global financial markets,"David Lodge, Ana-Simona Manu, Ine Van Robays","Using daily data since 2017, we disentangle China-specific structural shocks driving Chinese financial markets and examine spillovers across global markets. The novelty of this paper consists of simultaneously identifying China shocks with shocksemanating from the United States and shocks to global risk sentiment – two major forces driving global financial markets – to ensure that China spillover estimates do not reflect common factors. Our results show that shocks originating in China havematerial impacts on global equity markets, although spillovers are much smaller than those following shocks in the United States, or those triggered by shifts in global risk sentiment. By contrast, shocks from China account for a significant proportion of variation in global commodity prices, more on a par with those of the United States.

Endogenous Labor Supply in an Estimated New-Keynesian Model: Nominal versus Real Rigidities,"Isabel Cairo, Hess Chung, Francesco Ferrante, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Camilo Morales-Jimenez, Damjan Pfajfar","The deep deterioration in the labor market during the Great Recession, the subsequent slow recovery, and the missing disinflation are hard to reconcile for standard macroeconomic models. We develop and estimate a New-Keynesian model with financial frictions, search and matching frictions in the labor market, and endogenous intensive and extensive labor supply decisions. We conclude that the estimated combination of the low degree of nominal wage rigidities and high degree of real wage rigidities, together with the small role of pre-match costs relative to post-match costs, are key in successfully forecasting the slow recovery in unemployment and the missing disinflation in the aftermath of the Great Recession. We find that endogenous labor supply data are very informative about the relative degree of nominal and real wage rigidities and the slope of the Phillips curve.

"Pollution havens? Carbon taxes, globalization, and the geography of emissions","Christofer Schroeder, Livio Stracca","This paper studies the impact of national carbon taxes on CO2 emissions. To do so, we run local projections on a cross-country panel dataset, matching measures of emissions of carbon dioxide with information on the introduction of carbon taxes and their implied price. Importantly, we consider both measures of territorial emissions — emissions emitted within a country’s borders — and consumption emissions — emissions emitted anywhere in the world to satisfy domestic demand. We find that carbon taxes reduce territorial emissions over time, but have no significant effect on consumption emissions. Our estimates are robust to propensity-score weighting adjustments and are driven by countries which are more open to trade. Carbon taxes also lead to a modest increase in imports, suggesting that international trade may imply a negative carbon externality. Together, our findings highlight the limitations of national carbon taxes in isolation and the importance of international cooperation in reducing global emissions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2862~47f293b3f5.en.pdf?f6cd1ae7d0b87e7249261ba83d13fc26,2862,3-Nov-23,ECB,11/3/2023

An Alternative Measure of Core Inflation:  The Trimmed Persistence PCE Price Index,John O'Trakoun,"I introduce the ""trimmed persistence PCE,"" a new measure of core inflation in which component prices are weighted according to the time-varying persistence of their price changes. The components of trimmed persistence personal consumption expenditures (PCE) display less tendency to mechanically pass-through the level of the prior period's inflation to the current period; thus, the impact of the current stance of monetary policy and real economic factors are more likely to be visible in recent trimmed persistence inflation compared to headline inflation. Trimmed persistence inflation performs comparably to existing popular measures of core inflation in terms of volatility and relationship with economic slack. Model selection procedures confirm trimmed persistence PCE contributes additional information to inflation forecasting models when stacked against other popular measures of core inflation. Applying the new index in a Taylor rule analysis suggests the Fed's aggressive path of federal funds rate hikes during the pandemic may have achieved appropriately restrictive levels by the fourth quarter of 2022, clearing the way for more measured policy adjustment thereafter as risks of policy overshooting became more salient.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-10,23-10,27-Oct-23,FED-RICHMOND,11/3/2023
"Marketing, Other Intangibles, and Output Growth in 61 United States Industries","Leo Sveikauskas, Rachel Soloveichik, Corby Garner, Peter B. Meyer, James Bessen, Mathew Russell","Experts in the System of National Accounts (SNA) recently considered whether marketing could be included as a capital asset in the national accounts and later recommended that marketing should be an intangible in the 2025 SNA (IMF, 2022; IMF, 2023). This paper contributes to that discussion by developing macroeconomic measures of marketing investments and stocks for the United States. We also construct and analyze measures of how marketing and other intangibles contribute to output growth in the 61 industries that comprise the U.S. private business sector.We find that marketing contributes approximately as much to output growth as software and R&D (research and development) do. From 1987 to 2020, our preferred estimates of the annual contribution to output growth are 0.15 percentage point for R&D, 0.19 for software, and 0.18 for marketing. Software grows more rapidly, whereas marketing has a larger factor share. Marketing contributes even more to output if quality is adjusted to allow for better targeting associated with digital advertising.

Help wanted: the drivers and implications of labour shortages,"Martin Groiss, David Sondermann","Labour shortages have become prevalent across advanced economies. Yet, little is known about which firms are more likely to face them and the impact they have on the labour market. We create a firm-level data set spanning 28 EU countries, 283 regions and 18 sectors, contributing to close this gap. We find that structural factors play the dominant role. Firms in regions with limited labour supply as well as innovative and fast-growing firms are particularly prone to face labour shortages. Moreover, shortages tend to aggravate at business cycle peaks. In a second stage, we empirically determine the impact of labour shortages on wages and hiring. Firms with higher shortages pay a wage growth premium to keep and attract workers, increasingly so if they face excess demand. At the same time, those are the firms that hire less than the average.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2863~c22e538d33.en.pdf?724eb7da06eccc2cf9b60a16edee50be,2863,3-Nov-23,ECB,11/3/2023

We show that there is a wide range of outcomes on the financial system and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that could reasonably occur following CBDC issuance. Our analysis highlights that the potential effects on the financial sector depend critically on how the Fed manages its balance sheet. In particular, CBDC could in principle put substantial upward pressure on the spread of the federal funds rate and other wholesale funding rates over the interest rate on reserves unless the Fed expanded its balance sheet to accommodate CBDC issuance.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-effects-of-cbdc-on-the-federal-reserves-balance-sheet.htm,2023-068,Nov-23,FED-BOARD,11/3/2023

A Comprehensive Macroeconomic Uncertainty Measure for the Euro Area and its Implications to COVID-19,"Mariarosaria Comunale, Anh D. M.

The measure is constructed as the conditional volatility of the unforecastable components of a large set of time series, accounting for the monetary union as well as cross-country heterogeneity. MEU exhibits the largest spike at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and is noticeably different from other more financial-oriented and policy-driven uncertainty measures. It also reveals a significant increase in inflation uncertainty in 2021-2022. Our BVAR-based analysis shows that an unexpected increase in the MEU has a negative and persistent impact on euro area's industrial production, accounting for 80 percent of its reduction during the first wave of COVID-19, therefore supporting the interpretation of COVID-19 shock as a macroeconomic uncertainty shock. Public debt increases in response to this uncertainty shock.

Tax Policy and Investment in a Global Economy,"Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Matthew Smith, Owen Zidar, Eric Zwick","This paper combines administrative tax data and a model of global investment behavior to evaluate the investment and firm valuation effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the largest corporate tax reduction in the history of the United States. We extend the canonical model of Hall and Jorgenson (1967) to a multinational setting in which a firm produces in domestic and international locations. We use the model to characterize and measure four determinants of domestic investment: domestic and foreign marginal tax rates and cost-of-capital subsidies. We estimate elasticities of domestic investment with respect to each and use them to identify the structural parameters of our model, to quantify which parts of the reform mattered most to investment, and to conduct policy counterfactuals. We have five main findings. First, the TCJA caused domestic investment of firms with the mean tax change to increase by roughly 20% relative to firms experiencing no tax change. Second, the TCJA created large incentives for some U.S. multinationals to increase foreign capital, which rose substantially following the law change. Third, domestic investment also increases in response to foreign incentives, indicating complementarity between domestic and foreign capital in production. Fourth, the general equilibrium long-run effects of the TCJA on the domestic and total capital of U.S. firms are around 6% and 9%, respectively. Finally, in our model, the dynamic labor and corporate tax revenue feedback in the first 10 years is less than 2% of baseline corporate revenue, as investment growth causes both higher labor tax revenues from wage growth and offsetting corporate revenue declines from more depreciation deductions. Consequently, the fall in total corporate tax revenue from the tax cut is close to the static effect.",https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/tax-policy-and-investment-in-a-global-economy/,2023-141,"Nov 2, 2023",BFI,11/05/2023
Accounting for Goodwill,"Stefan J. Huber, Charles McClure","A significant portion of a merger’s purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Currently, goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment. When managers care about earnings, goodwill’s accounting treatment can have large effects on future earnings and may influence how much a manager will bid for a target company. We quantify the effects of goodwill accounting by estimating a structural model of corporate takeovers. Our estimates suggest that accrual accounting increases buyout premia by an average of nearly 10 percentage points. If firms needed to amortize goodwill over 10 years, we estimate premia would reduce by 6 percentage points and M&A volume would shrink by 4.29% or $68.6 billion per year. Furthermore, the fraction of private equity acquirers increases by 7.74 percentage points, shifting control over productive assets to the private and financial sector.

The Impact of Fake Reviews on Demand and Welfare,"Jesper Akesson, Robert W. Hahn, Robert D. Metcalfe, Manuel Monti-Nussbaum","Although fake online customer reviews have become prevalent on platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, little is known about how these reviews influence consumer behavior. This paper provides the first experimental estimates of the effects of fake reviews on individual demand and welfare. We conduct an incentive-compatible online experiment with a nationally representative sample of respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 10,000). Consumers are asked to choose a product category, browse a platform resembling Amazon, and select one of five equally priced products. One of the products is of inferior quality, one is of superior quality, and three are of average quality. We randomly allocate participants to variants of the platform: five treatment groups see positive fake reviews for an inferior product, and the control group does not see fake reviews. Moreover, some participants are randomly selected to receive an educational intervention that aims to mitigate the potential effects of fake reviews. Our analysis of the experimental data yields four findings. First, fake reviews make consumers more likely to choose lower-quality products. Second, we estimate that welfare losses from such reviews may be important—on the order of $.12 for each dollar spent in the setting we study. Third, we find that fake reviews have heterogeneous effects. For example, the effect of fake reviews is smaller for those who do not trust customer reviews. Fake reviews also have larger effects on those who shop online more frequently. Fourth, we show that the educational intervention reduces the adverse welfare impact of fake reviews by 44%.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31836,31836,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023

Long-term Care in Japan,"Rong Fu, Toshiaki Iizuka, Haruko Noguchi","Japan, renowned for its significantly aged population, presents a distinctive landscape in elderly care. Notably, there exists no apparent correlation between the economic well-being of the elderly and the limitations they experience in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). In response to the escalating demand for elderly care, Japan introduced the public Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system in 2000. This comprehensive program offers a wide spectrum of long-term care services, aiming to facilitate aging in place for seniors and alleviate the burdens on informal caregivers. Nevertheless, the LTCI system faces substantial challenges, predominantly related to financial sustainability and a shortage of human resources. Ongoing discussions center on achieving cost-effective service delivery, potential adjustments to premium rates and copayments, especially for individuals with ample financial resources or minimal care needs. Furthermore, debates surround the reduction of the age of eligibility for LTCI, with opposition stemming from intricate financial and structural considerations.

The A.I. Dilemma: Growth versus Existential Risk,Charles I. Jones,"Advances in artificial intelligence (A.I.) are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they may increase economic growth as A.I. augments our ability to innovate.

Asset Pricing in a Low Rate Environment,"Marlon Azinovic, Harold L. Cole, Felix Kubler","We examine asset prices in environments where the risk-free rate lies considerably below the growth rate. To do so, we introduce a tractable model of a production economy featuring heterogeneous trading  technologies, as well as idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. We show that allowing for the possibility of firms exiting is crucial for matching key macroeconomic moments and, simultaneously, the risk-free rate, the market price of risk, and price-earnings ratios. In particular, our model allows us to consider calibrations that match the high observed market price of risk and average interest rates as low as 2-3.5 percent below the average growth rate.  High values for risk aversion or non-standard preferences are not necessary for this. We use the model to examine the wealth distribution and asset prices in economies with very low real rates. We also examine under which conditions realistic calibrations allow for an infinite rollover of government debt. For our benchmark calibration, rollover is impossible even if the average risk-free rate lies 3.5 percent below the average growth rate.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31832,31832,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
Risk Preferences Implied by Synthetic Options,"Ian Dew-Becker, Stefano Giglio","The historical returns on equity index options are well known to be strikingly negative. That is typically explained either by investors having convex marginal utility over stock returns (e.g. crash/variance aversion) or by intermediaries demanding a premium for hedging risk. This paper examines the consistency of those explanations with returns on dynamically replicated, or synthetic, options. Theoretically, it derives conditions under which convex marginal utility leads synthetic options to also have negative excess returns. Empirically, synthetic options have CAPM alphas near zero over the period 1926--2022, in stark contrast to exchange-traded options. Over the last 15 years, returns on traded options have converged to those on synthetic options -- with the variance risk premium shrinking towards zero -- while various drivers of the cost and risk of hedging options exposures have declined, consistent with a model in which intermediaries drive option prices.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31833,31833,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
Lagged-Price Reimbursement Contracts: The Impact of Medicare Part B on Pharmaceutical Price Growth,"Angelique Acquatella, Keith Marzilli Ericson, Amanda Starc","We examine cost-plus lagged-price reimbursement contracts, focusing on Medicare Part B's payment for physician-administered drugs. Our theoretical model shows that lagged-price reimbursement can raise launch prices but lower prices in later periods. While previous research showed Part B increased launch prices, we estimate its effect on later prices (net of rebates). Drugs more exposed to Medicare have lower price growth. A drug with above median Part B exposure has a 10% lower price after 3 years than a below median exposure drug that launched at the same price, with a larger effect for newly approved molecules.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31834,31834,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
"Fiscal Influences on Inflation in OECD Countries, 2020-2022","Robert J. Barro, Francesco Bianchi","The fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL) has been active for 30 years, and the interest in this theory grew with the recent global surges in inflation and government spending.  This study applies the FTPL to 37 OECD countries for 2020-2022.  The theory’s centerpiece is the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, which relates a country’s inflation rate in 2020 2022 (relative to a baseline rate) to a composite government-spending variable.  This variable equals the cumulative increase in the ratio of government expenditure to GDP from 2020 to 2022, divided by the ratio of public debt to GDP in 2019 and the duration of the debt in 2019.  This specification has substantial explanatory power for recent inflation rates across 20 non-Euro-zone countries and an aggregate of 17 Euro-zone countries.  The estimated coefficients of the composite spending variable are significantly positive, implying that 40-50% of effective government financing came from the inverse effect of unexpected inflation on the real value of public debt, whereas 50 60% reflected conventional public finance (increases in current or future taxes or cuts in future spending).  Within the Euro area, inflation reacts mostly to the area-wide government-spending variable, not to individual values.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31838,31838,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
Long-term care in the Netherlands,"Pieter Bakx, Eddy Van Doorslaer, Bram Wouterse","We describe the financing and use of long-term care in the Netherlands. Public long-term care insurance is universal and comprehensive; user fees are low compared to other countries. We use linked survey and administrative data to document the distribution of the need for long-term care in the 65+ population, long-term care costs and how they are paid for. The findings reveal that no other country spends more per capita on publicly financed formal care than The Netherlands. A potential reason is that the threshold to receive formal care appears to be lower in the Netherlands than in other countries. Still, a considerable share of the adult population provides informal care. Caregiving is concentrated in specific demographic groups. The costs of informal care provision are considerable, but as a share of total spending on long term care they are smaller than in most developed countries. Adding the costs of informal care to formal care expenditures changes the view on who bears the costs of long-term care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31823,31823,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
Universalizing the Access to Long-term Care: Evidence from Spain,"Joan Costa-Font, Sergi Jimenez-Martin, Cristina Vilaplana-Prieto, Analía Viola","Spain together with Scotland are two countries that exhibit the largest expansions in long term care (LTC) in the last two decades, universalizing subsidies and supports. This paper is part of a global effort to provide a snapshot of the trends in LTC use and access, as well as the financing, and organization of the LTC system compared to other higher-income countries. The passage of Act 39/2006 on the Promotion of Personal Autonomy and Care for Dependent Persons (SAAD in Spanish) on December 14th, 2006, universalized coverage for care subsidies and supports, allowing access to care conditioned only on individuals’ assessment of care needs. As a consequence, LTC spending as a percentage of GDP has risen from 0.5% in 2003 to nearly 0.9% in 2019, despite private LTC insurance playing a minor role. Still today, LTC remains heavily reliant on informal care, which is now partially subsidized by a caregiving subsidy as part of SAAD. Long-term care spending in Spain amounts to between 1.27% (conservative estimates) and 1.70% (flexible estimation) of GDP. Finally, the system reveals significant gender imbalances in the provision of care, with women accounting for most caregivers in both formal (87%) and informal (58%) care.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31825,31825,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023

Partisan Traps,"Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Wioletta Dziuda","Electoral incentives may lead policymakers to eschew opportunities for common-interest reform, focusing instead on zero-sum, partisan policymaking. By forgoing opportunities for common-interest reforms, incumbents may convince their constituents that such reforms are rarely feasible, so that policymaking is primarily about zero-sum, partisan conflict. Voters with such beliefs vote based on ideological alignment, rather than factors such as quality or honesty. This is electorally beneficial for incumbents, who are typically ideologically aligned with their constituents. We capture this logic in an infinite horizon model and characterize the resulting dynamics of politics and policymaking. Equilibrium exhibits partisan traps---voters are pessimistic about common-interest opportunities, politicians behave in a purely partisan manner that shuts down voter learning, and ideologically aligned incumbents are consistently reelected. Partisan traps often occur in equilibrium even when common-interest reforms are in fact frequently feasible. The model shows how elite and mass polarization are intertwined, with politicians engaging in strategically polarized and polarizing behavior which leads to pessimistic beliefs among voters, who come to perceive there to be little political common ground.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31827,31827,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
Foreign Competition and Innovation,Elhanan Helpman,"Empirical studies have found that enhanced foreign competition can encourage or discourage innovation. To address this relationship, I examine a market structure in which a small number of large multi-product oligopolists compete with a large number of small single-product firms in the same industry. The single-product firms are short-lived while the multi-product firms live forever, and the large firms invest in innovation in order to enlarge their product spans. All firms export. I show that an increase in the competitiveness of foreign firms can increase or reduce innovation efforts of a large multi-product firm. Moreover, changes in the incentives to innovate can be different for more-productive and less-productive oligopolists. As a result, aggregate sectoral innovation may rise or decline, depending on the productivity distribution of the oligopolists. I also show that changes in short-term operating profits may not be aligned with changes in the incentives to invest in innovation.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31840,31840,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023

To Go Electric or To Burn Coal? A Randomized Field Experiment of Informational Nudges,"Hanming Fang, King King Li, Peiyao Shen","Coal heating in residential homes is an important source of indoor air pollution, leading to detrimental health effects. We conduct a randomized field experiment in northern China using three types of SMS campaigns targeting three potential biases that may hinder the adoption of electric heating: a Cost SMS campaign, designed to address the overestimation of electricity expenses; a Health SMS campaign, aimed at addressing the underestimation of health damage associated with coal heating; and a Social Comparison SMS campaign, intended to inform households about the popularity of electric heating. We find that the Cost SMS backfires: it instead leads to a substantial reduction in electric heating, which can be attributed to salience bias induced by the Cost SMS, which drew heightened attention to the cost of electricity. The Health SMS is ineffective for households that underestimate the health damage of coal heating and even backfires for those who expressed little concern about the health consequences. Social Comparison SMS is only effective for a small proportion of households who were concerned about their neighbors' heating choices. Overall, our findings suggest that SMS campaigns targeting these biases are largely ineffective, and caution should be exercised when applying plausible nudge interventions. The findings also suggest that households may be motivated to maintain their beliefs and resist paternalistic interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31841,31841,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
Preemptive Austerity with Rollover Risk,"Juan Carlos Conesa, Timothy J. Kehoe","By preemptive austerity, we mean a policy that increases taxes to deter potential rollover crises. The policy is so successful that the usual danger signal of a rollover crisis, a high yield on new bonds sold, does not show up because the policy eliminates the danger. Mechanically, high taxes make the safe zone in the model — the set of sovereign debt levels for which the government prefers to repay its debt rather than default — larger. By announcing a high tax rate at the beginning of the period, the government ensures that tax revenue will be high enough to service sovereign debt becoming due, which deters panics by international lenders but is ex-post suboptimal. That is why, as it engages in preemptive austerity, the government continues to reduce the level of debt to a point where, asymptotically, high taxes are no longer necessary.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31828,31828,November 2023,NBER,11/06/2023
On the estimation of distributional household wealth: addressing under-reporting via optimization problems with invariant Gini coefficient,"Janina Engel, Dennis Ohlwerter, Matthias Scherer","The Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provides valuable information for the monetary policy and financial stability purposes. The dataset shows, however, inconsistencies with National Account (NtlA) statistics, as the aggregated HFCS micro data do usually not match the corresponding NtlA macro data. Therefore, we suggest a solution to close the gap via an optimization problem that aims at preserving for each wealth instrument the level of inequality measured by the Gini coefficient. In addition, a lower and an upper bound of inequality are derived, that can be reached by extreme allocations of the wealth discrepancies across the households. Finally, based on the German HFCS, we compare the findings with another approach suggested in the literature that uses a “multivariate calibration”. The comparison indicates that the multivariate calibration may reallocate households’ wealth beyond the observed discrepancies, thereby leading to Gini coefficients that exceed the analytically derived upper bound of inequality.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2865~2c76fbb179.en.pdf?781d771f6fc810cb59b54f01f9870889,2865,6 November 2023,ECB,11/06/2023

A deep dive into the capital channel of risk sharing in the euro area,"Natalia Martín Fuentes, Alexandra Born, Franziska Bremus, Wieger Kastelein, Claudia Lambert","This paper investigates the contribution of capital markets to international risk sharing in the euro area over the 2000Q1-2021Q1 period. It provides three main contributions: First, the estimation of country-specific vector autoregressions (VAR) shows that shock absorption through capital markets remains modest, particularly in the southern euro area. Second, we analyse the geographical patterns of the capital channel. While risk sharing between southern and northern euro area countries led the improvements in income smoothing at the beginning of the 2000s, intra-regional capital flows supported income smoothing in the recent past. Third, based on a panel threshold VAR, we analyse how the composition of external capital positions impacts the capital channel. Long-term portfolio debt assets and liabilities as well as equity liabilities significantly improved income smoothing. The effect is more pronounced for northern countries, in line with their larger cross-border portfolios, when compared to the southern countries. Regarding foreign direct investment, only northern countries benefited from inward positions.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2864~bc6d7b989f.en.pdf?d0fd1a1e0e6260469b2e484b020ffa02,2864,6 November 2023,ECB,11/06/2023

Hawkish or Dovish Fed? Estimating a Time-Varying Reaction Function of the Federal Open Market Committee's Median Participant,Manuel González-Astudillo and Rakeen Tanvir,"This paper estimates a time-varying reaction function of the median participant of the Federal Open Market Committee, using a Taylor rule with time-varying coefficients estimated on one- to three-year ahead median forecasts of the federal funds rate, inflation, and the unemployment rate from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). We estimate the model with Bayesian methods, incorporating the effective lower bound on the median federal funds rate projections. The results indicate that the monetary policy rule has become significantly more persistent after the pandemic than in the years prior, and it currently reacts strongly to inflation, at more than twice the responsiveness estimated prior to 2020. Our proposed policy rule produces accurate predictions of the median federal funds rate projections in real time for given SEP forecasts of inflation and the unemployment rate, suggesting that the median participant's reaction function is well-represented by our assumed Taylor rule with time-varying coefficients. Our results show that the median participant's reaction function becomes less persistent and less responsive to inflation yet more responsive to the output gap in anticipation of tighter monetary policy conditions, measured by a steeper yield curve. We also find that labor market activity, inflation, and macroeconomic uncertainty correlate significantly with the evolution of the time-varying coefficients of the rule. Finally, we show that in times of a less persistent policy rule or more responsiveness to inflation, markets perceive nominal bonds as better macroeconomic hedges.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/hawkish-or-dovish-fed-estimating-a-time-varying-reaction-function-of-the-federal-open-market-committees-median-participant.htm,2023-070,November 2023,FED-BOARD,11/07/2023
"Late Payment Fees and Nonpayment in Rental Markets, and Implications for Inflation Measurement: Theoretical Considerations and Evidence","Wesley Janson, Randal J. Verbrugge","Accurate rent measurement is essential for constructing a consumer price index (CPI) and for measuring household welfare. Late payment fees and nonpayment of rent are common components of rental expenditures and thus belong in CPIs. Late payment fees are often excluded; we offer a novel critique. In the US CPI, nonpayment is ostensibly included, but, we show, severely undermeasured. Moreover, the manner of its inclusion renders the CPI extremely sensitive to nonpayment variations; we show how to fix this. Nonpayment undermeasurement suggests at least a +1 ppt overestimate in 2020 CPI shelter inflation. Timely nonpayment and late fee measurement is challenging; we offer a practical solution.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2022r2-late-payment-fees-and-nonpayment-in-rental-markets,20-22R2,11.06.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/07/2023
The effects of labor income risk heterogeneity on the marginal propensity to consume,Ettore Savoia,"Using detailed micro-data, this paper documents that households with lower income risk (and higher income levels) exhibit a higher Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) in response to transitory income shocks, all else being equal. This finding is particularly significant among unconstrained households and supported by models with precautionary saving only if designed to account for the empirically observed negative correlation between income levels and income risk. This interaction generates saving dynamics such that the stationary distribution of wealth among households facing different risk levels is not polarized.Therefore, it is possible to compare their respective MPCs within wealth and identify the reduction in MPC due to labor income risk. Otherwise, the effects of income risk are masked by wealth effects. In neither case, the MPC depends on (permanent, persistent, or current) income levels, whose direct effect on the MPC is always ambiguous. Finally, simulations of targeted fiscal rebates for specific labor categories reveal that governments cannot simultaneously stimulate aggregate demand and mitigate income risk.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2866~a11841e627.en.pdf?e27e8b262c477eb3434f0bd4764d3f29,2866,7 November 2023,ECB,11/07/2023
Disincentive Effects of Unemployment Insurance Benefits,"Andreas Hornstein, Marios Karabarbounis, André Kurmann, Etienne Lalé and Lien Ta","Unemployment insurance (UI) acts both as a disincentive for labor supply and as a demand stimulus which may explain why empirical studies often find limited effects of UI on employment. This paper provides independent estimates of the disincentive effects arising from the largest expansion of UI in U.S. history, the pandemic unemployment benefits. Using high-frequency data on small restaurants and retailers from Homebase, we control for local demand effects by comparing neighboring businesses that largely share the positive impact of UI stimulus. We find that employment in low-wage businesses recovered more slowly than employment in high-wage businesses in labor markets with larger differences in the relative generosity of pandemic UI benefits. According to a labor search model that replicates the estimated employment differences between low- and high-wage businesses, the disincentive effects from the pandemic UI programs held back the aggregate employment recovery by 4.7 percentage points between April and December 2020.",https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp_23-11,23-11,"November 03, 2023",FED-RICHMOND,11/07/2023

Global and local drivers of Bitcoin trading vis-à-vis fiat currencies,"Paola Di Casola, Maurizio Michael Habib, David Tercero-Lucas","We analyse the drivers of Bitcoin transactions against 44 fiat currencies in the largest peer-to-peer crypto exchanges. Momentum and volatility in the cryptoasset market, as well as volatility and liquidity in global financial markets do matter for Bitcoin trading. There is suggestive evidence of a global crypto cycle driven by speculative motives. However, in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), Bitcoin seems to offer also transactional benefits, since trading increases when the value of the domestic currency is unstable. Proxies of banking depth and digitalisation are negatively correlated with the currency loadings on the global factor, indicating that crypto-assets may offer a speculative alternative to traditional finance when this is not available, especially in EMDEs where the share of younger risk-prone population is higher. Our results clearly point to potential financial stability risks from cryptoisation in EMDEs with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2868~0c2ad2e6e7.en.pdf?d6c30bb110bfb610a1f23569a7bc920c,2868,8 November 2023,ECB,11/08/2023

The bright side of the doom loop: banks’ sovereign exposure and default incentives,"Luis E. Rojas, Dominik Thaler","The feedback loop between sovereign and financial sector insolvency has been identified as a key driver of the European debt crisis and has motivated an array of policy proposals. We revisit this “doom loop” focusing on governments’ incentives to default. To this end, we present a simple 3-period model with strategic sovereign default, where debt is held by domestic banks and foreign investors. The government maximizes domestic welfare, and thus the temptation to default increases with externally-held debt. Importantly, the costs of default arise endogenously from the damage that default causes to domestic banks’ balance sheets. Domestically-held debt thus serves as a commitment device for the government. We show that two prominent policy prescriptions – lower exposure of banks to domestic sovereign debt or a commitment not to bailout banks – can backfire, since default incentives depend not only on the quantity of debt, but also on who holds it. Conversely, allowing banks to buy additional sovereign debt in times of sovereign distress can avert the doom loop. In an extension we show that in the context of a monetary union (such as the euro area) similar unintended negative consequences may arise from the pooling of debt (such as European safe bond aka. ESBies). A backstop by the central bank (such as the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument) can successfully disable the loop if precisely calibrated.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2869~83394dbfea.en.pdf?6007176d2b9d32db6f784d4e28156d26,2869,8 November 2023,ECB,11/08/2023
Nothing Gold Can Stay: Artisanal Mine Certifications and Conflict Dynamics in the Congo,"Samuel Chang, Hans Christensen","We examine how conflict-free certifications for artisanal mines—used to comply with provision 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act—affect conflict dynamics in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

After certifications, there is no aggregate reduction in conflict intensity in Eastern DRC territories, but conflicts intensify further away from certified mines, consistent with certifications displacing, not reducing, conflicts.

Congestion in Onboarding Workers and Sticky R&D,Justin Bloesch and Jacob P. Weber,"R&D investment spending exhibits a delayed and hump-shaped response to shocks. We show in a simple partial equilibrium model that rapidly adjusting R&D investment is costly if the probability of converting new hires into productive R&D workers (“onboarding”) is decreasing in the number of new hires (“congestion”). Congestion thus causes R&D-producing firms to slowly hire new workers in response to good shocks and hoard workers in response to bad shocks, providing a microfoundation for convex adjustment costs in R&D investment. Using novel, high-frequency productivity data on individual software developers collected from GitHub, a popular online collaboration platform, we provide quantitative evidence for such congestion. Calibrated to this evidence, a sticky-wage new Keynesian model with heterogeneous investment-producing firms subject to congestion in onboarding and no other frictions yields hump-shaped responses of R&D investment to shocks.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1075.html,1075,November 2023,FED-NEWYORK,11/08/2023

Using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with Markov-switching policy rules, we identify three distinct monetary/fiscal regimes in France and Italy: a Passive Monetary-Active Fiscal regime (PM/AF) before the late 80s/early 90s; an Active Monetary-Passive Fiscal regime (AM/PF) with central bank independence and EMU convergence; a third regime with policy rates at the effective lower bound combined with fiscal active behavior to sustain the recovery. Our simulations reveal that the PM/AF regime in France led to price volatility and debt stabilisation, while the AM/PF regime resulted in disinflation and rising debt trajectory. Meanwhile, Italy’s procyclical fiscal policy in downturns contributed to persisting imbalances, high aggregate volatility, and low growth.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2871~2f10ce452d.en.pdf?2bc9de5bd8206b8e3f93a64e2576877d,2871,9 November 2023,ECB,11/09/2023

Financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy,"Paul Bochmann, Daniel Dieckelmann, Stephan Fahr, Josef Ruzicka","We empirically analyze the interaction of monetary policy with financial stability and the real economy in the euro area. For this, we apply a quantile vector autoregressive model and two alternative estimation approaches: simulation and local projections. Our specifications include monetary policy surprises, real GDP, inflation, financial vulnerabilities and systemic financial stress. We disentangle conventional and unconventional monetary policy by separating interest rate surprises into two factors that move the yield curve either at the short end or at the long end. Our results show that a build-up of financial vulnerabilities tends to be accompanied initially by subdued financial stress which resurges, however, over a medium-term horizon, harming economic growth. Tighter conventional monetary policy reduces inflationary pressures but increases the risk of financial stress.

Can Everyone Tap into the Housing Piggy Bank? Racial Disparities in Access to Home Equity,"James Conklin, Kristopher Gerardi, Lauren Lambie-Hanson","An earlier version of this paper was posted as Atlanta Fed Working Paper 2022-17. During the 2018–2021 period, Black homeowners’ mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications were rejected at almost double the rate of White homeowners (44% versus 23%), while Hispanic and Asian homeowners also experienced significantly higher denial rates (32% and 30%, respectively). These racial disparities in denials are much larger than those associated with purchase and rate/term refinance mortgage applications. Controlling for loan and borrower characteristics commonly used in the underwriting process significantly reduces the MEW disparities, with the Black-White denial rate gap falling by approximately 83%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by 73%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the racial gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. Large disparities remain after controlling for underwriting factors, and these “residual” disparities vary significantly across lenders. While there are numerous potential drivers of the residual disparities, the paper shows that they tend to be larger in geographic areas characterized by more racial animus, which suggests that discriminatory forces may play a role.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/consumer-credit/can-everyone-tap-into-the-housing-piggy-bank-racial-disparities-in-access-to-home-equity,23-25,"October 24, 2023",FED-PHILADELPHIA,11/09/2023
Nothing Gold Can Stay: Artisanal Mine Certifications and Conflict Dynamics in the Congo,"Samuel Chang, Hans Christensen","We examine how conflict-free certifications for artisanal mines—used to comply with provision 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act—affect conflict dynamics in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Certifications are associated with a 9.4% (16.3%) reduction in armed group–initiated conflicts (fatalities) within a 10-kilometer radius of gold mines. After certifications, there is no aggregate reduction in conflict intensity in Eastern DRC territories, but conflicts intensify further away from certified mines, consistent with certifications displacing, not reducing, conflicts.

Did Fintech Loans Default More During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Were Fintech Firms “Cream-Skimming” the Best Borrowers?,"Julapa Jagtiani, Catharine Lemieux, Brandon Goldstein","Studies of fintech lending have shown that their digital access and ability to leverage alternative data have increased accessibility in underserved areas, enabled consumers with thin credit files to obtain credit, and provided a lower cost alternative to long-term credit card financing. This paper exams three questions: (1) Do proprietary loan rating systems accurately predict the likelihood of default? (2) Can a proprietary loan rating system, leveraging alternative data, that was developed in a favorable economic period continue to perform well under adverse economic conditions (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)? (3) Have fintechs been “cream skimming,” i.e., underpricing the cost of credit to top-tier customers? This study uses data from LendingClub, one of the largest fintech lenders in the personal loan market.

The Optimal Supply of Central Bank Reserves under Uncertainty,"Gara  Afonso, Gabriele La Spada, Thomas M. Mertens, and John C.

We fully characterize the optimal supply of central bank reserves and associated market equilibrium. We find that the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than that absent uncertainty. With a sufficient degree of uncertainty, it is optimal to supply a level of reserves that is abundant (on the flat portion of the demand curve) absent shocks. The optimal mean spread between the market interest rate and administered rates under uncertainty may be higher or lower than that absent uncertainty.

"Heterogeneous Districts,  Interests, and Trade Policy","Kishore Gawande, Pablo M. Pinto and Santiago Pinto","Congressional districts are political entities with heterogeneous trade policy preferences due to their diverse economic structures. Representation of these interests in Congress is a crucial aspect of trade policymaking that is missing in canonical political economy models of trade. In this paper, we underscore the influence of districts by developing a political economy model of trade with region-specific factors. Using 2002 data from U.S. Congressional Districts, we first characterize the unobserved district-level demand for protection. Extending the model beyond the small country assumption to account for export interests as a force countering protection, we develop a model of national tariff-setting. The model predictions are used to estimate the welfare weights implied by tariff and non-tariff measures enacted nationally. Our supply-side explanation for trade policy, while complementing Grossman and Helpman (1994), reveals district and industry-level patterns of winners and losers, central to understanding the political consequences of trade and the backlash against globalization.

The Economic Consequences of Social Unrest: Evidence from Initial Public Offerings,"Philip Barrett, Thomas J. Boulton, Terry D. Nixon","Prior research attributes negative stock market performance following episodes of social unrest to elevated uncertainty. However, social unrest does not solely increase uncertainty, but separately acts to decrease investor sentiment. To determine which effect dominates, we study initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, which responds differently to changes to uncertainty and investor sentiment. Consistent with the notion that social unrest dampens investor sentiment, we find robust evidence that IPO first-day returns are lower during times of greater social unrest. Limits to arbitrage intensify the negative relation between social unrest and underpricing. Notably, strong institutional frameworks mitigate the impact of social unrest on underpricing, suggesting that quality institutions weaken the link between investor sentiment and returns.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/The-Economic-Consequences-of-Social-Unrest-Evidence-from-Initial-Public-Offerings-541410,WPIEA2023232,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
The Pass-through of Wages to Consumer Prices in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Sectoral Data in the U.S.,"Moya Chin, Li Lin","We study the pass-through of labor costs to prices using a novel data-set that links industry-level wages to sectoral consumer prices through input-output tables. Pass-through increased during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, temporarily in goods and persistently in services. Our analysis suggests that the elevated pass-through contributed at least 0.8 percentage points to goods inflation in 2021 and 0.7 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to services inflation in 2021 and 2022, respectively. We find that the increase in pass-through reflects elevated demand in goods sectors and firms' difficulty in absorbing high wage growth in services sectors. The analysis suggests it will take a reduction in wage growth to bring PCE inflation back to target.

Quantifying the Revenue Yields from Tax Administration Reforms,"Hassan Adan, Jean-Marc B. Atsebi, Nikolay Gueorguiev, Jiro Honda, Manabu Nose","Despite the criticality of tax administration (TA) reforms in enhancing domestic revenue mobilization, few studies have attempted to quantify the revenue impact of such reforms. This paper fills this gap by estimating the revenue yields associated with various tax administration capabilities, based on the International Survey on Tax Administration (ISORA), the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT), and TA reform episodes datasets (identified by Akitoby et al., 2020). It uses a Hausman-Taylor cross-country panel regression and an event study for specific TA reform episodes. Our results (using the ISORA data) show that an increase in the overall strength of TA from the 40th percentile to the 60th percentile is associated with an increase in tax revenue by 1.8 pp. of GDP (with a 95 percent confidence range of 0.5‒2.6 pp. of GDP). Similarly, the event-study assessment shows that sustained TA reforms led to an increase in tax revenues between 2 to 3 pp. of GDP, in line with the experience in three country cases (Jamaica, Rwanda, and Senegal). Also, the revenue yields are increasing over time to more than 3 pp. of GDP after the 6th year following a comprehensive reform. The analysis also highlights the significant impact of specific measures including: i) strengthening compliance risks management, ii) enhancing public accountability, iii) establishing Large Taxpayer Offices (LTO), iv) strengthening accountability and transparency, and v) enhancing timely filing of tax declarations.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/Quantifying-the-Revenue-Yields-from-Tax-Administration-Reforms-541407,WPIEA2023231,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
Trade Diversion Effects from Global Tensions—Higher Than We Think,"Mengqi Wang, Swarnali A Hannan","The paper builds a unique industry-level dataset by combining Mexico’s nationally sourced inputoutput data (INEGI) with cross-country sources (WIOD, UN Comtrade). Using this dataset to exploit higher supply linkages across a larger number of industries than what is available in cross-country sources, the paper estimates the trade diversion effect on Mexico’s exports to the U.S. from two episodes, with a focus on the first: the U.S.-China trade tension in 2018 and the U.S. sanctions on Russia in 2014. Difference-in-differences, local projections and few other empirical methodologies are used. For the first episode, the paper finds higher trade diversion effects than estimates in literature. Output tariff plays an important role, and there is some evidence of a positive impact through downstream tariffs. The effects are stronger when nationally sourced input-output data is used compared to those derived from cross-country sources. Importantly, the magnitude of trade diversion across industries does not depend on Mexico’s industry-level trade exposure to the U.S., but rather on the U.S. tariff changes on Chinese goods, the decrease in imports from China, product substitutability with Chinese products, and (weakly) on Mexico’s GVC integration. Similarly, for the second episode, the paper finds positive trade diversion effects. Overall, the findings suggest that trade diversion effect might be higher than previously thought and the proper accounting of dataset and supply linkages makes a difference.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/Trade-Diversion-Effects-from-Global-Tensions-Higher-Than-We-Think-539680,WPIEA2023234,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
FINEX - A New Workhorse Model for Macroeconomic Forecasting and Policy Analysis,"Andrew Berg, Yaroslav Hul, Philippe D Karam, Adam Remo, Diego Rodriguez Guzman","This paper presents a semi-structural macroeconomic model aimed at facilitating policy analysis and forecasting, primarily in countries with imperfect capital mobility and hybrid monetary policy regimes. Compared to earlier gap-trend projection models, the Forecasting Model of Internal and External Balance (FINEX) contains three main innovations: it accentuates external and internal balances; explicitly incorporates fiscal policy; and partly endogenizes the main trends. FINEX thus covers a broad set of policy instruments, including foreign exchange interventions (FXI), capital flow management measures (CFM), as well as common fiscal policy instruments. The model incorporates insights from the recent DSGE literature, while maintaining a more accessible gap-trend structure that lends itself to practical policy applications. While the paper refrains from drawing broad policy lessons, it emphasizes the model's ability to interpret recent data in terms of structural shocks and policy responses, thereby aiding policymakers in constructing coherent economic narratives and considering alternative scenarios.",https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/11/10/FINEX-A-New-Workhorse-Model-for-Macroeconomic-Forecasting-and-Policy-Analysis-541416,WPIEA2023235,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 ",IMF,11/10/2023
The Impact of Right-to-Work Laws on Long Hours and Work Schedules,"Osea Giuntella, Rania Gihleb, Jian Qi Tan","Unions play a crucial role in determining wages and employment outcomes. However, union bargaining power may also have important effects on non-pecuniary working conditions. We study the effects of right-to-work laws, which removed agency shop protection and weakened union powers on long hours and non-standard work schedules that may adversely affect workers' health and safety. We exploit variation in the timing of enactment across US states and compare workers in bordering counties across adopting states and states that did not adopt the laws yet. Using the stacked approach to difference-in-differences estimates proposed by Cengiz et al. (2019), we find evidence that right-to-work laws increased the share of workers working long hours by 6%, while there is little evidence of an impact on hourly wages. The effects on long hours are larger in more unionized sectors (i.e. construction, manufacturing, and transportation). While the likelihood of working non-standard hours increases for particular sectors (education and public administration), there is no evidence of a significant increase in the overall sample.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31867,31867,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Long-term Care in Italy,"Agar Brugiavini, Ludovico Carrino, Giacomo Pasini","The provision of long-term care (LTC) for senior citizens in Italy is at the center of the recent policy debate. Italy has witnessed a spectacular increase in the share of people aged 65 and over and in particular of people aged 80 and over, which could translate in large increases in the number of people in need of care. We show that individuals who are in need of LTC have lower economic resources than the average, so that many frail older people have little financial means to pay out-of-pocket for formal care. In fact, publicly provided care is highly fragmented, with stark differences emerging in terms of coverage and generosity across Italian regions. Hence, the supply of LTC is relying heavily on the informal support of members of the family, especially women, at the same time formal care is characterised by a significant underground economy of unskilled carers.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31861,31861,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023

Longitudinal administrative data from North Carolina show that having a Black same-grade peer significantly improves the achievement and reduces the suspension rates of white teachers’ Black students. Open-ended interviews of North Carolina public school teachers reaffirm these findings.

Our econometric model demonstrates that publications likely suffer from non-classical measurement error. Using horse race and instrumental variable models, we confirm that the Gold Standard data are relatively free from measurement error but show that the Clarivate data suffer from non-classical measurement error. We employ a variety of methods to adjust the Clarivate data for false negatives and false positives and demonstrate that with these adjustments the data produce estimates very similar to the Gold Standard.

Life and Death at the Margins of Society: The Mortality of the U.S. Homeless Population,"Bruce D. Meyer, Angela Wyse, Ilina Logani","This paper examines the relationship between extreme socioeconomic disadvantage and poor health by providing the first detailed and accurate picture of mortality patterns among people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. Our analyses center on 140,000 people who were sheltered or unsheltered homeless during the 2010 Census, by far the largest sample ever used to study this population and the only sample designed to be nationally representative. These individuals, along with housed comparison groups, are linked to Social Security Administration data on all-cause mortality from 2010-2022 to estimate the magnitude of health disparities associated with homelessness. We find that non-elderly people experiencing homelessness have 3.5 times the mortality risk of those who are housed, accounting for differences in demographic characteristics and geography, and that a 40-year-old homeless person faces a similar mortality risk to a housed person nearly twenty years older. Our results reveal notable patterns in relative mortality risk by age, race, gender, and Hispanic ethnicity and suggest that within the homeless population, employment, higher incomes, and more extensive observed family connections are associated with lower mortality. The mortality hazard of homeless individuals rose by 33 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase that, while similar in proportional terms to the increase for the housed population, affected a much larger share of the homeless population due to their substantially elevated baseline mortality rate. These findings elucidate the persistent hardships associated with homelessness and show that the well-documented gradient between health and poverty persists into the extreme lower tail of socioeconomic disadvantage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31843,31843,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023

We quantify the impact of Japan’s low-rate policies on its government and households. Because of the duration mismatch on the government balance sheet, the government’s fiscal space expands when real rates decline, allowing the government to keep its promises to older Japanese households. A typical younger Japanese household does not have enough duration in its portfolio to continue to finance its spending plan and will be worse off. Low-rate policies tax younger, poorer and less financially sophisticated households.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31850,31850,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
When do Treasuries Earn the Convenience Yield? — A Hedging Perspective,"Viral V. Acharya, Toomas Laarits","We document that the convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries exhibits properties that are consistent with a hedging perspective of safe assets. The convenience yield tends to be low when the covariance of Treasury returns with the aggregate stock market returns is high. A decomposition of the aggregate stock-bond covariance into terms corresponding to the convenience yield, the frictionless risk-free rate, and default risk reveals that the covariance between stock returns and the convenience yield itself drives the effect in a substantive capacity. We show the convenience yield is reduced with heightened inflation expectations that erode the hedging properties of U.S. Treasuries and other fixed-income money-like assets, inducing a switch to alternatives such as gold; it is also reduced immediately prior to debt-ceiling standoffs and with increases in Treasury supply.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31863,31863,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023

Differences in How and Why Social Comparison and Real-Time Feedback Impact Resource Use: Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Mark A. Andor, Lorenz Goette, Michael K. Price, Anna Schulze Tilling, Lukas Tomberg","We compare the behavior and welfare effects of two popular interventions for resource conservation. The first intervention is social comparison reports (SC), which primarily provide consumers with information motivating behavioral change. The second intervention is real-time feedback (RTF), which primarily provides consumers with information facilitating behavioral change. In a field experiment with around 1,000 participants, we directly observe the interventions’ effects on participants’ behavior. Further, we elicit participants’ willingness to pay for receiving the interventions, both before and after having experienced them for one month. We find that SC leads to a reduction in water use per shower by 9.4%, RTF by 28.8%, and the combination (BOTH) by 35.0%. Our willingness to pay results show that all interventions are highly valued by participants and that willingness to pay for RTF and BOTH is significantly higher than for SC. Furthermore, we find that the valuation of the interventions do not change following one-month experience. Our results suggest that while both interventions improve welfare, providing consumers with information facilitating behavioral change achieves a higher impact and a slightly higher welfare increase than providing consumers with information motivating behavioral change.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31845,31845,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Job Transitions and Employee Earnings After Acquisitions: Linking Corporate and Worker Outcomes,"David Arnold, Kevin S.

Using firm balance sheet data linked to individual earnings data in Canada and a matched difference-in-differences design, we find that after M&As acquirers expand while targets shrink substantially relative to their matched control groups. Additionally, profit margins decrease for both acquirers and targets in the medium run. Furthermore, workers at target firms suffer losses in earnings, and this decline in earnings is entirely driven by workers who move to other firms after an M&A event. We find that workers leaving target firms after M&As move to larger firms with higher wage premiums, but with much worse match qualities on average.

Svensson,"According to ECB (2023) and European Systemic Risk Board (2022), Swedish owner-occupied housing (OOH) was overvalued by about 55% in 2021q2, the largest overvaluation in the EU and EEA; according to European Commission (2023c), by about 30% in 2022.

Long-term Care in Germany,"Johannes Geyer, Axel H. Börsch-Supan, Peter Haan, Elsa Perdrix","This chapter provides an overview of the German long-term care insurance. We document care needs and wellbeing of the elderly population. Moreover, we provide a detailed description of the German long-term care institutions (sources of finance and types of benefits), the professional care work force, and informal caregivers. Finally, we document expenditures on long-term care and estimate the value of informal care. The cost of long-term care for the elderly (65+), including both cost of nursing home and home health agency, reached 61 billion euro in 2019. Half of these spending are for nursing homes while only about 22.5% of beneficiaries use these institutions. Out-of-pocket spending differs greatly between modes of care. Out-of-pocket expenditures make up only about 7% of total expenditures for home care. In nursing homes, 41% of expenditures are out-of-pocket payment. Most of the expenditures are covered by the long-term care insurance. The share of other governmental schemes in expenditures for inpatient care is relatively high. This is explained by a high rate of benefit recipients who cannot afford co-payments for nursing homes: about one-third of all nursing home residents receive means- and wealth-tested social assistance. If we add the costs of informal care the share of privately financed care amounts to nearly 60% of total expenditures.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31870,31870,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Implications of Asset Market Data for Equilibrium Models of Exchange Rates,"Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig","We characterize the relation between exchange rates and their macroeconomic fundamentals without committing to a specific model of preferences, endowment or menu of traded assets. When investors can trade home and foreign currency risk-free bonds,  the exchange rate appreciates in states that are worse for home investors than foreign investors. This prediction is at odds with the empirical evidence and can only be overturned if the deviations from U.I.P. are large and exchange rates are highly predictable. Without bond Euler equation wedges, it is impossible to match the empirical exchange rate cyclicality (the Backus-Smith puzzle) and the deviations from U.I.P. (the Fama puzzle) as well as the lack of predictability (the Meese-Rogoff puzzle). To relax this trade-off, we need Euler equation wedges consistent with a home currency bias, home bond convenience yields or financial repression.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31851,31851,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
"Forecasting the Impact of Racial Uprisings, Market versus Stakeholders' Expectations","Bocar A. Ba, Roman Rivera, Alexander Whitefield","Given police abolitionism’s new visibility after the 2020 racial justice protests, we assess stakeholder beliefs on the protests’ stock impacts on police-affiliated firms. Experts generally underestimate the firms’ stock gains, except situated experts like community organizers and police experts, who link the market responses to reforms, not budget cuts. An experiment with nonexperts and finance professionals shows negatively skewed stock predictions among respondents lacking information on policing products and no effect of exposure to narratives about the protests on forecast alignment. National data show enduring support for police reform despite abolitionist advocacy and little understanding of the Defund movement’s objectives.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31857,31857,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Perspectives on the Labor Share,Loukas Karabarbounis,"As of 2022, the share of U.S. income accruing to labor is at its lowest level since the Great Depression. Updating previous studies with more recent observations, I document the continuing decline of the labor share for the United States, other countries, and various industries. I discuss how changes in technology and product, labor, and capital markets affect the trend of the labor share. I also examine its relationship with other macroeconomic trends, such as rising markups, higher concentration of economic activity, and globalization. I conclude by offering some perspectives on the economic and policy implications of the labor share decline.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31854,31854,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
What Drives Booms and Busts in Value?,"John Y. Campbell, Stefano Giglio, Christopher Polk","Value investing delivers volatile returns, with large drawdowns during both market booms and busts. This paper interprets these returns through an intertemporal CAPM, which predicts that aggregate cash flow, discount rate, and volatility news all move value returns.  We document that indeed these shocks explain a large fraction of quarterly value returns over the last 60 years. We also distinguish between the intra-industry and inter-industry components of value, showing that the ICAPM explains the former better. Finally, we develop a novel methodology to perform this decomposition at the daily frequency, using it to interpret value returns during the Covid-19 pandemic.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31859,31859,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
"One Says Goodbye, Another Says Hello: Turnover and Compensation in the Early Care and Education Sector","Flavio Cunha, Marcos Lee","The quality of the early environment children experience influences their human capital development. We investigate retention and compensation in the Early Care and Education workforce by merging datasets from three different government agencies in Texas. We employ non-structural methods to compare turnover and pay in Early Care and Education with those in other sectors that employ similar workers. We estimate a dynamic discrete choice occupational model to quantify the labor supply and turnover elasticities in this industry. In addition, we simulate the impact of wage supplementation programs.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31869,31869,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
The Long-Term Distributional Impacts of a Full-Year Interleaving Math Program in Nigeria,"Lotte van der Haar, Guthrie Gray-Lobe, Michael Kremer, Joost de Laat","This study reports the findings from a year-long randomized evaluation assessing the impact of assigning 62 classrooms in Nigeria to receive either blocked or interleaved math problem sets. Blocked practice sessions focused on a single skill at a time. Interleaved problem sets alternated between different skills within a practice session. On tests of short-term retention, interleaved practice increased test scores by 0.29 standard deviations. In contrast, we find no evidence that interleaving improves average performance on a cumulative assessment measuring retention of material over the academic year. We find some evidence of large impacts on the cumulative assessment at the bottom of the distribution, but these impacts appear to be offset by negative impacts at the top.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31853,31853,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Policymakers' Uncertainty,"Anna Cieslak, Stephen Hansen, Michael McMahon, Song Xiao","Uncertainty is a ubiquitous concern emphasized by policymakers. We study how uncertainty affects decision-making by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We distinguish between the notion of Fed-managed uncertainty vis-a-vis uncertainty that emanates from within the economy and which the Fed takes as given. A simple theoretical framework illustrates how Fed-managed uncertainty introduces a wedge between the standard Taylor-type policy rule and the optimal decision. Using private Fed deliberations, we quantify the types of uncertainty the FOMC perceives and their effects on its policy stance. The FOMC's expressed inflation uncertainty strongly predicts a more hawkish policy stance that is not explained either by the Fed's macroeconomic forecasts or by public uncertainty proxies. We rationalize these results with a model of inflation tail risks and argue that the effect of uncertainty on the FOMC's decisions reflects policymakers' concern with maintaining credibility for the inflation anchor.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31849,31849,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
The Long-run Effect of Air Pollution on Survival,"Tatyana Deryugina, Julian Reif","Many environmental hazards produce health effects that take years to arise, but quasi-experimental studies typically measure outcomes and treatment over short time periods. We develop a new approach to overcome this challenge and use it to gauge the effect of exposure to air pollution on US life expectancy. Using changes in wind direction as an instrument for daily sulfur dioxide levels, we first characterize the short-run mortality effects of acute exposure during the time period 1972-1988. Exposure causes two distinct mortality patterns: a short-run mortality displacement effect, and a persistent accelerated aging effect. We then incorporate our estimates into a flexible health production model to quantify the lifelong effects of chronic air pollution exposure for a cohort born in 1972. Model calculations of the effect of chronic exposure on life expectancy are 7-8 times larger than the effect implied by simple extrapolation of our short-run empirical estimates. Ninety percent of the survival benefits accrue after the first fifty years of life, implying that most of the 1970 Clean Air Act's health benefits have yet to emerge for cohorts born after its passage.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31858,31858,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
The Deposit Business at Large vs. Small Banks,"Adrien d&#039;Avernas, Andrea L. Eisfeldt, Can Huang, Richard Stanton, Nancy Wallace","The deposit business differs at large versus small banks.  We provide a parsimonious model and extensive empirical evidence supporting the idea that much of the variation in deposit-pricing  behavior between large and small banks reflects differences in ""preferences and technologies.""  Large banks offer superior liquidity services but lower deposit rates, and locate where customers value their services.  In addition to receiving a lower level of deposit rates on average, customers of large banks exhibit lower demand elasticities with respect to deposit rate spreads.  As a result, despite the fact that the locations of large-bank branches have demographics typically associated with greater financial sophistication, large-bank customers earn lower average deposit rates.  Our explanation for deposit pricing behavior challenges the idea that deposit pricing is mainly driven by pricing power derived from the large observed degree of concentration in the banking industry.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31865,31865,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
"Who Invests in Crypto? Wealth, Financial Constraints, and Risk Attitudes","Darren Aiello, Scott R. Baker, Tetyana Balyuk, Marco Di Maggio, Mark J. Johnson, Jason D. Kotter","We provide a first look into the drivers of household cryptocurrency investing. Analyzing consumer transaction data for millions of U.S. households, we find that, except for high income early adopters, cryptocurrency investors resemble the general population. These investors span all income levels, with most dollars coming from high-income individuals, similar to equity investors. High past crypto returns and personal income shocks lead to increased cryptocurrency investments. Higher household-level inflation expectations also correlate with greater crypto investments, aligning with hedging motives. For most U.S. households, cryptocurrencies are treated like traditional assets.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31856,31856,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Safety Reviews on Airbnb: An Information Tale,"Aron Culotta, Ginger Zhe Jin, Yidan Sun, Liad Wagman","Consumer reviews, especially those expressing concerns of product quality, are crucial for the credibility of online platforms. However, reviews that criticize a product or service may also dissuade buyers from using the platform, creating an incentive to blur the visibility of critical reviews.  Using Airbnb and official crime data in five major US cities, we find that both reviews and self experiences concerning the safety of a listing's vicinity decrease guest bookings on the platform. Counterfactual simulations suggest that a complete removal of vicinity safety reviews (VSR) would hurt guests but increase revenues from reservations on Airbnb, with positive sorting towards listings formerly with VSR. Conversely, incorporating VSR in a listing's overall ratings or highlighting VSR could generate opposite effects. Either way, the interests of consumers are not always aligned with the interests of a revenue-centric platform. Because VSR are more closely correlated with official crime statistics in low-income and minority neighborhoods, our findings suggest that suppressing or highlighting VSR would have different effects on different neighborhoods.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31855,31855,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Technology and Labor Displacement: Evidence from Linking Patents with Worker-Level Data,"Leonid Kogan, Dimitris Papanikolaou, Lawrence D.W. Schmidt, Bryan Seegmiller","We develop measures of labor-saving and labor-augmenting technology exposure using textual analysis of patents and job tasks. Using US administrative data, we show that both measures negatively predict earnings growth of individual incumbent workers. While labor-saving technologies predict earnings declines and higher likelihood of job loss for all workers, labor-augmenting technologies primarily predict losses for older or highly-paid workers. However, we find positive effects of labor-augmenting technologies on occupation-level employment and wage bills. A model featuring labor-saving and labor-augmenting technologies with vintage-specific human capital quantitatively matches these patterns. We extend our analysis to predict the effect of AI on earnings.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31846,31846,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Identification using Revealed Preferences in Linearly Separable Models,"Nikhil Agarwal, Pearl Z. Li, Paulo J. Somaini","Revealed preference arguments are commonly used when identifying models of both single-agent decisions and non-cooperative games. We develop general identification results for a large class of models that have a linearly separable payoff structure. Our model allows for both discrete and continuous choice sets. It incorporates widely studied models such as discrete and hedonic choice models, auctions, school choice mechanisms, oligopoly pricing and trading games. We characterize the identified set and show that point identification can be achieved either if the choice set is sufficiently rich or if a variable that shifts preferences is available. Our identification results also suggests an estimation approach. Finally, we implement this approach to estimate values in a combinatorial procurement auction for school lunches in Chile.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31868,31868,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
"Financial Windfalls, Portfolio Allocations, and Risk Preferences","Joseph S. Briggs, David Cesarini, Sean Chanwook Lee, Erik Lindqvist, Robert Östling","We investigate the impact of financial windfalls on household portfolio choices and risk exposure. Exploiting the randomized assignment of lottery prizes in three Swedish lotteries, we find a windfall gain of $100K leads to a 5-percentage-point decrease in the risky share of household portfolios. We show theoretically that negative wealth effects are consistent with both constant and decreasing relative risk aversion and analyze how our empirical estimates help distinguish between competing models of portfolio choice. We further show our results are quantitatively aligned with the predictions of a calibrated dynamic portfolio choice model with nontradable human capital and consumption habits.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31864,31864,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Do Water Audits Work?,"Jesper Akesson, Robert W. Hahn, Rajat Kochhar, Robert D. Metcalfe","Water suppliers are showing greater interest in using different mechanisms to promote conservation. One such mechanism is conducting home water audits, which involves assessing water use and providing tailored suggestions for conserving water for residential customers. Yet, very little is known about the economic impacts of these water audits. This paper helps fill this gap by implementing a natural field experiment in the United Kingdom. The experiment involves randomly allocating 45,000 water customers to a control group or to treatment groups that receive different behavioral encouragements to take-up an online water audit. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, encouraging subjects to participate in an audit with financial incentives reduces household consumption by about 17 percent over two months. Furthermore, we find that the size of the financial incentive used to encourage conservation matters for take-up, but not conservation. Second, notwithstanding these improvements in water conservation, the per capita net benefits of the intervention are close to zero under a wide range of assumptions. We also implement a marginal value of public funds approach that considers benefits and costs and we reach a similar conclusion. Third, we find that targeting of high users could double the effectiveness of the financial incentive interventions.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31831,31831,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
A Framework for Geoeconomics,"Christopher Clayton, Matteo Maggiori, Jesse Schreger","Governments use their countries’ economic strength from existing financial and trade relationships  to achieve geopolitical and economic goals. We refer to this practice as geoeconomics. We build a framework based on three core ingredients: input output linkages, limited contract enforceability, and externalities. Geoeconomic power arises from the ability to jointly exercise threats arising from separate economic activities.  Being able to retaliate against a deviating country across multiple arenas, often involving indirect threats from third parties also being pressured, increases the off equilibrium threats and, thus, helps in equilibrium to increase enforceability. A world hegemon, like the United States, exerts its power on firms and governments in its economic network by asking these entities to take costly actions that benefit the hegemon. We characterize the optimal actions and show that they take the form of mark-ups on goods or higher rates on lending, but also import restrictions and tariffs. The input-output amplification makes controlling some sectors more valuable for the hegemon since changes in the allocation of these strategic sectors have a larger influence on the world economy. This formalizes the idea of economic coercion as a combination of strategic pressure and costly actions. We apply the framework to two leading examples: national security externalities and the Belt and Road Initiative.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31852,31852,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
Do banks practice what they preach? Brown lending and environmental disclosure in the euro area,"Leonardo Gambacorta, Salvatore Polizzi, Alessio Reghezza, Enzo Scannella","This study examines whether the level of environmental disclosure in banks’ financial reports matches less brown lending portfolios. Using granular credit register data and detailed information on firm-level greenhouse gas emission intensities, we find a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and brown lending. However, this effect is contingent on the tone of the financial report. Banks that express a negative tone, reflecting genuine concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend less to more polluting firms. Conversely, banks that express a positive tone, indicating lower concern and awareness of environmental risks, tend to lend more to polluting firms. These findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness of environmental risks, so that banks perceive them as a critical and urgent pressing threat, leading to a genuine commitment to act as environmentally responsible lenders.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2872~b91ebffb71.en.pdf?b21c1346272b8634718a98691ff7b90f,2872,10 November 2023,ECB,11/13/2023
Designing Difference in Difference Studies With Staggered Treatment Adoption: Key Concepts and Practical Guidelines,"Seth M. Freedman, Alex Hollingsworth, Kosali I. Simon, Coady Wing, Madeline Yozwiak","Difference-in-Difference (DID) estimators are a valuable method for identifying causal effects in the public health researcher’s toolkit. A growing methods literature points out potential problems with DID estimators when treatment is staggered in adoption and varies with time. Despite this, no practical guide exists for addressing these new critiques in public health research. We illustrate these new DID concepts with step-by-step examples, code, and a checklist. We draw insights by comparing the simple 2 × 2 DID design (single treatment group, single control group, two time periods) with more complex cases: additional treated groups, additional time periods of treatment, and with treatment effects possibly varying over time. We outline newly uncovered threats to causal interpretation of DID estimates and the solutions the literature has proposed, relying on a decomposition that shows how the more complex DID are an average of simpler 2X2 DID sub-experiments.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31842,31842,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
The Active Role of the Natural Rate of Unemployment during Cyclical Recoveries,"Robert E. Hall, Marianna Kudlyak","We propose that the natural rate of unemployment has an active role in the business cycle, in contrast to the prevailing view that the rate is essentially constant. We demonstrate that this tendency to treat the natural rate as near-constant would explain the surprisingly low slope of the Phillips curve. We show that the natural rate closely tracked the actual rate during the long recovery that began in 2009 and ended in 2020. We explain how the common finding of research in the Phillips-curve framework of low---often extremely low---response of inflation to unemployment could be the result of fairly close tracking of the natural rate and the actual rate in recoveries. Our interpretation of the data contrasts to that of most Phillips-curve studies, that conclude that inflation has little relation to unemployment. We suggest that the flat Phillips curve is an illusion caused by assuming that the natural rate of unemployment has little or no movement during recoveries.",https://www.nber.org/papers/w31848,31848,November 2023,NBER,11/13/2023
The Effects of the Federal Reserve Chair’s Testimony on Interest Rates and Stock Prices,"Matthew V. Gordon, Kurt G. Lunsford","We study how congressional testimony about monetary policy by the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System affects interest rates and stock prices. First, we study testimony associated with the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Reports (MPRs) to Congress. Testimony for a particular MPR is usually given on two days, one day for each chamber of Congress. We separately study the first day and second day of MPR testimony. We also study testimonies not associated with MPRs but that are still related to monetary policy. We find that first-day MPR testimonies cause the largest movements in interest rates and generate negative co-movement between interest rates and stock prices. Testimonies not associated with MPRs have similar but weaker effects. Second-day MPR testimonies cause the smallest movements in interest rates and generate no co-movement between interest rates and stock prices.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/wp-2326-federal-reserve-chairs-testimony-effects,23-26,11.13.2023,FED-CLEVELAND,11/14/2023
